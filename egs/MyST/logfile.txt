Input Options:
    -r reffile [ <rfmt> ]
                Define the reference file, and it's format
    -h hypfile [ <hfmt> <title> ]
                Define the hypothesis file, it's format, and a 'title' used
                for reports.  The default title is 'hypfile'.  This option
                may be used more than once.
    -i <ids>    Set the utterance id type.   (for transcript mode only)
    -P          Accept the piped input from another utility.
    -e gb|euc|utf-8 [ case-conversion-localization ]
                Interpret characters as GB, EUC, utf-8, or the default, 8-bit ASCII.
                Optionally, case conversion localization can be set to either 'generic',
                'babel_turkish', or 'babel_vietnamese'
Alignment Options:
    -s          Do Case-sensitive alignments.
    -d          Use GNU diff for alignments.
    -c [ NOASCII DH ]
                Do the alignment on characters not on words as usual by split-
                ting words into chars. The optional argument NOASCII does not
                split ASCII words and the optional arg. DH deletes hyphens from
                both the ref and hyp before alingment.   Exclusive with -d.
    -L LM       CMU-Cambridge SLM Language model file to use in alignment and scoring.
    -S algo1 lexicon [ ASCIITOO ]
    -S algo2 lexicon [ ASCIITOO ]
                Instead of performing word alignments, infer the word segmenta-
                tion using algo1 or algo2.  See sclite(1) for algorithm details.
    -F          Score fragments as correct.  Options -F and -d are exclusive.

                word distances based on times. Options -F and -d are exlc.
    -w wwl      Perform Word-Weight Mediated alignments, using the WWL file 'wwl'.
                IF wwl is 'unity' use weight 1.o for all words.
    -m [ ref | hyp ]
                Only used for scoring a hyp/ctm file, against a ref/stm file.
                When the 'ref' option is used, reduce the reference segments
                to time range of the hyp file's words.  When the 'hyp' option
                is used, reduce the hyp words to the time range of the ref
                segments.  The two may be used together.  The argument -m
                by itself defaults to '-m ref'.  Exclusive with -d.
Output Options:
    -O output_dir
                Writes all output files into output_dir. Defaults to the
                hypfile's directory.
    -f level    Defines feedback mode, default is 1
    -l width    Defines the line width.
    -p          Pipe the alignments to another sclite utility.  Sets -f to 0.

    -o [ sum | rsum | pralign | all | sgml | stdout | lur | snt | spk | 
         dtl | prf | wws | nl.sgml | none ]
                Defines the output reports. Default: 'sum stdout'
    -C [ det | bhist | sbhist | hist | none ] 
                Defines the output formats for analysis of confidence scores.
                Default: 'none'
    -n name     Writes all outputs using 'name' as a root filename instead of
                'hypfile'.  For multiple hypothesis files, the root filename
                is 'name'.'hypfile'

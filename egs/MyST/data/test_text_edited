myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-44-52_EE_2.2_002 a we were doing a p bell on solar panels and housing work
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-44-52_EE_2.2_017 it is a parallel circuit
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-44-52_EE_2.2_005 it shares it s own pathway
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-44-52_EE_2.2_020 they provisions in the positive side but not the negative side
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-44-52_EE_2.2_022 they are probably instead a light bulbs and back to the d cell and then are some are going are some are going to the other light bulb and passing back through the light bulb if first one
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-44-52_EE_2.2_008 the parallel circuits they share energy and the series circuit do nothing they not share
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-44-52_EE_2.2_015 they are
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-44-52_EE_2.2_014 they are sharing energy and going back to the batteries but someone going to the other light bulb so it is parallel circuit
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_005 because it is a open circuit
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_027 they are all connected to the and positive side and there all sharing a so first of the from the small the little one then middle one and then the large one
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_032 see you next time learning
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_011 that the the light bulb has so much on power going into way
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_029 that and the first one its it close how will breakes and the second one shows how it shows
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_030 it is the same because if the one of them is broken then the other light bulb will work because the energy is in flow through
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_025 the circuit that middle one breaks because there are sharing energy and then middle one get so much power
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_015 it would speakers ah if it s a close circuit when it is going around and if it is in open circuit and the energy is going out of a lower
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_028 yeah it will not work because it is not flow
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_012 that light the other light bulb will not work
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_031 because the light bulb and is the one that gives
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_021 it will
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_018 light bulb is broken because it is getting too much power and it snaps front side and the other light bulb can run anymore
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_004 and it will not work because theirs is an open circuit and if there is an open circuit it will work because the energy is going out of to now work and in a closed circuit it work so that is enough
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_003 that they are
myst_008051_2014-04-17_10-57-20_EE_2.3_020 the energy does not and go it does not flow through the light bulb anymore
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_014 it could make it stick together but we had one washer and the magnets would space separate
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_007 it will not work because you need nineteen into the magnet was separate
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_020 the magnets would be separate with the less magnet
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_006 if you put one washer and keep adding more the magnet was still be with the other magnet but if both into it get to nineteen it is stops
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_021 they will not touch they were only be kind of close but not allow
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_017 the magnets are and with the force are getting the spacers
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_013 the magnets are together because of the fields around it and right two magnets still touch each other but only a little bit but this so stick the iron
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_005 there is two magnets once called the magnet base ah for therefore and then one other magnet goes to goes with the other magnet but when you put at the washers it will
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_015 the iron spacers and also the magnets are touching from the field kind of flows but we could a washer and the other cup they would not be together anymore
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_010 basic force of the magnet it would now be together so there would be separate now
myst_008051_2014-04-28_09-35-42_EE_3.4_012 what it does is separate the magnets but the magnets are so on be together because of the field around to magnet
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_018 has stick to the magnet because the magnet i mean that no use iron or steel and then the what is in
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_040 it might have iron
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_025 what different but are one of them is steel or also iron and one of them might be copper
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_003 they are magnet
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_038 it is takes because it is made out of iron
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_027 one of the know might be steel or iron but one might be copper
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_036 i think it is steel
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_039 because a paper clip is made out of iron that a type of iron that is take are two magnets
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_011 the magnet is stick to is attracting to the nail
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_007 all the magnets as take to the refrigerator
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_033 it will not work
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_023 the nail i mean the magnet is going to the nail on the right and its do not welcome back it does not work because of its might be copper
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_026 its know one of the knows not taking up one is
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_024 some knows can be copper so you can lift up that you can setup with the magnet
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-19-50_EE_3.1_032 if three of them do not shake before to stick
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_009 you are need to use a close circuit for it work
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_019 when it is a open circuit it does not work when it is a close circuit it is start good
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_017 electromagnet is it had electricity in it would also small bits but also has small bits of magnet
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_006 because the nail has the wires wrapped around it and like the wires are kind of iron it is but it also has a graber with the nail also gets electricity
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_010 well it was an open circuit that one the battery will we say other wire facing the negative side well work because it is an open circuit and the electricity is going to no where
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_020 if it is an open circuit and that means that is the flow of electricity will go out to no where
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_013 there is a lot of zero there is a field a magnetic field around the wire wrapped around the nail because it has some of electricity and magnet
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_008 that there is a battery with washers under wire is wrapped around the nail
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_022 it will not work
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_004 with a battery a switch some wires a wire and i do not know
myst_008051_2014-04-30_13-36-57_EE_4.1_014 they have to like the electricity is going back inside the battery and then out and then inside again
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-33-45_EE_3.2_014 a function because it is attracting the other magnets
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-33-45_EE_3.2_007 because there is the first
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-33-45_EE_3.2_006 the poor is going with that magnet is going because
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-33-45_EE_3.2_009 when they repel each other they it is south to south for that means it needs to be south to north and north to south and north to north will not work
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-33-45_EE_3.2_005 there would be they will not stick together because north in north pole bigger to get
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-33-45_EE_3.2_004 the magnet is sticking on to the other magnet because it is north and south and it
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-33-45_EE_3.2_010 either it is facing south north or north south
myst_008051_2014-04-23_09-33-45_EE_3.2_011 umm two of the magnets are attracting to each other but to it is three of the magnets are not attracting they are repelling each other
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_031 they are useful cars and trains and that one is on their left side useful people and houses and the energy on your corner would have
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_009 yes it was hot
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_019 you get energy by hitting the drum
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_007 the candle has energy from the fire there is
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_015 i could see ah
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_014 it started to flame up
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_033 well because you the one okay energy some energy from coal and from gasoline you just get energy from the the others on the left for people
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_032 i would burn and then it would get a franky and didn t bla
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_012 so energy is ah like the source
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_030 cars and trains use gas and a coal to work
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_028 and the the one on the left side is energy and one on the right side is energy like car yeah
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_021 i see energy going to oppose the candle the water and the gasoline
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_026 are the solar panels are getting energy and there from the rock is going to the water and then the waters were
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_024 and the air is getting third year yeah
myst_008051_2014-04-09_09-43-48_EE_1.4_017 the is playing and then ah is getting energy by playing the drums
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_022 when you add two batteries with two light bulbs are it give brighter but one of the light bulbs were broken so that means it will be bright anymore and it will and then at the the second light bulb
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_006 energy has go to light bulb from the d cell but
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_025 that there has to be a and in positive side to work and if there is just a and in positive side it work at all
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_009 which going end from the positive side and coming out to negative side and going in that two light bulbs
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_020 the light bulbs would have too much light and then so there would be so bright
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_011 those are the energy source
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_016 there was three from the wires its depends on the one
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_023 at which two d cells the battery the light bulbs get brighter and with one the light bulbs are dark bright
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_012 the moving dots are energy that goes into light bulb and hence through the wires and
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_015 it goes through out the negative side and then line from the wire it gets start the energy and then it go like through the battery then the light bulb from
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_024 it doesn t flowing because and the there has to be a and negative side connect to the wires and then this it make its negative connect to the and the positives are just going in switch
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_013 other from the wires it goes to the light bulb and then for
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_017 i think the light bulbs will be the much bright
myst_008051_2014-04-10_10-24-39_EE_2.1_019 the light bulbs well and shine not much anymore
myst_008051_2014-05-01_09-32-30_EE_4.1_012 it is going around to revit but not through the revit and it is acting like a magnet when there is like open and i mean a close circuit
myst_008051_2014-05-01_09-32-30_EE_4.1_006 because the magnet and it does not like attract to anything else that tried but when it but when there is a electricity called magnet
myst_008051_2014-05-01_09-32-30_EE_4.1_003 they are d cell battery washers a swich a wire and a steel they which
myst_008051_2014-05-01_09-32-30_EE_4.1_013 because the rivets is in a magnet and so the electricity is
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_029 what happen is that the light is going through the filter that is making it blue or else
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_006 the light is shining through the prism is going first it is white
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_027 they turn red or else dark
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_031 it is not the same color a red one
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_026 it connects because the light is going through the the red x ray i think it is turning it is turning red
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_018 the light bulb is white when it bounces off of when it is when it is going to the blue ball but when it bounces off the blue ball it
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_010 i see seven colors
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_020 when is happening is it the light bulb it is going to the a yellow ball and it is bouncing off that is yellow
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_014 what is happening is that there is three waves going to the ball two are they are going away and one is not
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_011 they are white and then they spread out into others
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_013 when the light is on it reflects to the blue ball
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_024 when it bounces off the yellow ball it turns yellow but when it bounces off the white ball it turns i mean blue ball it turns blue
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_033 when when you try to click on the blue one it will not work but when you try to click on the red one
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_025 what is going on is that the lights the flash light is just white and the red x ray it turns everything else red that is why
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_016 this is a reflecting through the ball
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_004 that is the light is white but when it is orange it is wrong
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_032 because it is
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_005 it is a light bulb that is that is like going to the pyramid that is made of glass and that
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_015 when it is bouncing off of the ball the ball is blue so the light is turning blue when it hits the blue ball
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_009 it turns into rainbow like colors
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_003 all of them have one is a light bulb that has light another one is a sun that has light and another one is a candle that also has light
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_019 what is happening is that it is like the blue ball at first it is white and then when it bounces off the yellow ball it is white yellow
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_030 it would just turn dark
myst_008051_2014-05-12_10-37-57_EE_5.2_007 the light goes through the prism and then it is rainbow colors
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_007 the batteries have energy and them for they could make things work
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_022 on the positive side gets the energy and in the negative side gives the energy to light bulb
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_003 a battery a light bulb and wires
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_017 you could put a some of the wires to the light and the battery to make it shine
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_030 if the one wire is connected to the one wire is connected to the and both of them are with the battery
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_016 it means that if you light almost anything
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_025 if you switch the batteries ah the negative side gets the push outs the energy and then the positive side gets the energy but it goes in a different way and the energy goes through the a light bulb in back
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_023 the positive ah the negative side goes to the light bulb and then back to positive side with the wire
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_009 the source could get energy
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_011 it means that the pathways of the wires is the wires have screen could go through that and like electronic under the
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_008 you could light of any
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_024 the blue dots represents all the energy coming out of the negative side
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_031 one of the wires is connected to the and one of the wire it is with the positive
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_020 if you use d cell energy with the wires the wires will get energy to the light bulb
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_026 the the if you switched the body they would so work because in the positive side pushes out energy in the negative gets and
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_021 the negative side
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_018 i see and the wires are attracting the light bulb and about these are the to make the light bulb
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_034 they will not work give they do not the base but if there on the other sides they would work
myst_008051_2014-04-04_10-32-50_EE_1.1_005 are the wires could connect through the light i mean so a light bulb and a shine with the battery
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_018 it will work because it is rubber
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_020 because the straw is rubber
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_028 see you next time
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_011 a close circuit
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_009 was this sponge it will not work
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_006 laser paper clip the motor is working
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_014 some of them are
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_015 the motor is not working because the stick is wood
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_003 are connected to the switch
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_027 a brass ring a paper clip a paper is steel nail and a steel
myst_008051_2014-04-08_09-18-49_EE_1.3_019 it is not ah like the others
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_027 what is different is because when you put the water and lower the pencil down in it the pencil the pencil is not straight it is like kind of cut out and then down and then it the air is that does it
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_009 it is something if it hits a mirror it reflects of it but if it hits your eye then you can see the light
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_018 in the room the light reflects to almost anything except the wall
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_021 she is using the sun with the mirror that the sun is reflecting through the mirror and that she could make a like a a light shadow
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_024 well it is eventually to hit the star it is on the very left right
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_019 what is happening is that the light is reflecting through the mirror and then going into the person is eye
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_026 when it is lower into the water the pencil moves
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_017 it is interesting because it also reflects to the couch and the couch and the couch or and the dog because the dog is made out of fur and it is weird but also the dog reflects
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_020 he is able to see because the light goes through in goes with a mirror and then it reflects to everywhere else and with his the it like goes to the mirror and then he sees his
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_025 what is going on is the pencil is in the water
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_012 the light reflects to anything
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_023 what is happening is that the light is kind of and then it is like spread out and it is going through one mirror going to the other one but it does not catch the star
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_008 it is important to see things
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_016 if it hits one of the objects in the room it reflects to everything else
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_028 no because it was not i thought that when you put the pencil in it it just going to be straight but it is kind of curved out but it is not broken
myst_008051_2014-05-06_09-31-27_EE_5.1_005 you see the light
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_020 it is different because the magnet is giving like a force to the nail for the paper clip which take on
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_025 the magnet has a force with field around it then that giving to nail the field and then when you say and then the magnet the nail is giving to field and then it is getting them paper clips that has a field and if we take to magnet of the nail does not have the filed anymore
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_019 because the nail is the magnetism crertain the paper clip produce still up picking on so the nail is acting like a magnet because it has the no just paper clips it has gone to away
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_023 two magnets has a force around it so the nail could not get that but like acting like a magnet and then other paperclip has above if would around it
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_002 we have been working on magnet and filaments
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_010 the magnet is under the table and one is above the table so the magnet under the table at you reverse you somewhere else the magnet on top will follow it on top yeah
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_028 it is showing you the field around then
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_006 they are still sticking together
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_017 the magnet is on the nail and the nail sticking on to the paper clip
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_027 it will not be sticking on to the paper to then that this because the magnet when you pull out away the field is around it but not
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_030 the magnet has a field around it and they need to going through the nail to the paper clip
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_008 it is table and there is a magnet on top of the table and around it is table and the magnet is still going through the
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_007 the paper is it will be two but the magnet it is going and the paper clip is still
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_013 the magnet has like a field around it that is get like anything
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_014 the magnet has field around it so to stick anything that is made out of iron
myst_008051_2014-04-25_09-45-20_EE_3.3_005 a magnet is a paper clip is on the magnet but a paper between both of them
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_029 the solar panels get energy and then it goes to the motor
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_012 it is not touching the wire so the motor does not work
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_026 the flag would move because the solar panels need sun light work
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_025 ah because the energy goes
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_033 the solar panels are are getting energy from the sun
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_030 and the motor is working
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_003 you have wires and a battery with a motor the wire you connect the wires to the batteries both sides and the motor will work
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_031 the motor will work because of the sun
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_024 that means that it is working so there is a close circuit
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_006 energy has flow to go through the wires to the motor
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_034 two wires are connected to the and the negative side and you are also connected to the motor if when the motor could work
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_010 on the bottom is touching the wires and then the wire is touching a motor when could
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_023 sun it has to heat the solar panels ah and then the wires connect to the solar panel and then energy goes through to the motor
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_011 in the positive side has a small wire that connects to a metal part that goes to the motor
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_007 it means it is working
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_008 energy is going through wires to the motor
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_016 it has to be in a close circuit for the energy could go through the wire
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_013 the motor works
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_021 the sun heats the solar panels and there is solar panels get energy to work
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_019 it has to be a closed circuit to work
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_020 the motor does not work because there is an open circuit
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_017 when it is open the motor does not move but when it is closed the motor moves
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_015 the motor does not work
myst_008051_2014-04-07_14-07-44_EE_1.2_022 the sun is lighting so the solar panel is gets sun light and then there is some wires connected to a motor because the motor that
myst_996438_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_018 long or short string
myst_996438_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_026 the string is
myst_996438_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_021 smaller penny smaller kind of coin or paperclip or more paperclip
myst_996438_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_012 i am not sure
myst_996438_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_025 a pendulum with string paperclip and penny in fifteen centimeters
myst_996438_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_006 string with paperclip and then put penny
myst_996438_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_014 do not get it
myst_996438_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_022 do not have a clue

myst_996438_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_019 swing and release
myst_996438_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_013 i put on the table and swung it three times
myst_996438_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_015 help you with maths
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_010 the angle and the distance the cork flew
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_008 in science i could not think of any so i did not change any
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_011 that the ball on the top is bigger and the one on the bottom is s s
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_002 flippers and catapults
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_021 i do not get it
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_003 the flipper is is you get a stick and put it in the thing and then there is a rubber cork and you flip it
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_017 object and mass length distance and the angle
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_024 e the results are the same thing you just have the b the ta the f first one is small tin foil one and the second one is the large one
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_013 it says that they both went one centimeter
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_026 i do not get it
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_004 i do not get it
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_016 the obj the angle is a number and the mass is the kind of ball that they that they use the flip to do flip the thing
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_027 we were doing the planes and making graphs and testing them
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_012 they went the same distance
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_022 because maybe other things would not work for the graph
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_025 how to i mean when you when you do when you do a kind of a experiment this is what you are supposed to do
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_009 it was about testing to see how far it went
myst_996438_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_019 a complicated graph
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_006 we made lines on the cup and we cut where that was to make boats
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_015 passengers in boats
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_013 i do not know do not know i do not know
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_018 boats with passengers as pennies
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_010 putting dimes or pennies for passengers in the boat
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_002 life wa boats
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_021 make it in actual boats
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_023 make it bigger capacity
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_011 for my boats small was s seven medium was eight and big was twenty-five to make it sink
myst_996438_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_017 the one with the twenty has more than the one with the twelve
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_019 i do not know
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_009 i can not really explain
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_015 well the magnet is on a nail that is steel and since the magnet is on the nail it is kind of making the mag the nail magnetic
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 i do not know
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_020 well the nail can not stick to the paper clip because the magnet is not on the nail but if when the magnet is on the nail it can stick cause like the magnetic force is going into the nail so that so the nail can pick up the paper clip
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_018 i think it is about like the magnet is like making like kind of putting magnetic force or something in the nail so the nail can pick up the paper clip or stick on to other things
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 i can not explain
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 no i do not know
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 well when the magnet touches the nail it makes the nail magnetic pretty much so when the nail touches the paper clip it makes it so the so the nail can pick up the paper clip
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_022 well the magnet is turning the nail pretty much into a magnet just for a short little bit of time but then after a little bit the nail will go back to not being a magnet and yeah
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_002 we are learning about magnetic stuff
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_023 well you have to put the magnet on the nail for a few seconds or so and then you take the magnet off and then you can put the nail on something else and you stick
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_011 well on the th thicker paper it will not stick cause it is too thick but on the thinner paper it is thin so it can stick
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014 i do not know
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_021 what is happening is the magnet is going across the nail giving the nail enough like magnetic stuff inside of it pretty much well the the nail well the magnet is
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_006 well the magnets are sticking together even though there is a surface blocking it they still can stick
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_017 well the long silver object is a nail and so when the magnet is on the nail it can pick up the paper clip
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_013 i do not know really
myst_998670_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_003 well if you put a magnet on steel then it will stick and the if it is on but if it is not on steel or like or if it is on aluminum then it will not work it will not stick
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_002 i have been learning about the energy with the motor and several light bulbs and how it works and how it makes the motor move
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_024 it won t work we were going do that today also but it was cloudy day so it didn t work it wasn t going to work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_010 this is where the motor and the switch where the wires are connected the switch and then wires are touching the battery but in order for it swork you need the switch to touch the one side so that the motor for the flag on the motor will move that is why the motor is working
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_016 when it put is when i clicked to switch it went to the middle part and it made the motor work but when i clicked it again it went back in it the motor reflects start move
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_021 the light has to be how touching the solar panel so the energy goes from sun to the solar panel and through the wires so it makes the motor work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_020 the flag is moving because the sun is down hitting the solar panel so that the wires go through touch the motor and make it work i know this because we kindly did this in class and you told me this last time and when you clicked on it when the sun was away it will work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_014 it doesn t work because the there is no path way for it to go the battery and back to the motor because it s this middle part that the wire is on that the switch is in touching is not it and then that s how the energy moves through in to the battery and back to the motor
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_027 the energy comes down to the solar panel through the wires to the motor to make work so that s how energy flows from the sun that s one when it s a cloudy day there is no sun and you can see it and it doesn t work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_007 the energy is going through the wire like a path way for the energy like you told me last time for the light bulb it s a path way for the energy to move to that it is called the motor
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_004 is important because that s how you know that the motor is working
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_017 the switch is touching well is like closed
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_029 when there is no sun the flag is moving that means that the motor is not working because the energy is not going to the solar panel
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_009 it is the energy and it s kind of like a car you need the battery for the car for its work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_003 the motor the flag on the motor is moving
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_006 wire the wires has to be one has to be on the negative side of the battery and other needs to be a wire on the positive side of the battery and both of them need to be connected to the motor so that it will work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_028 it makes the solar panel have energy to go through the wires to the motor you showed me this before and that can enough
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_012 the flag on the motor starts working so that means the motor is working but when the switch is not touching it not work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_001 good how are you
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_026 when it s cloudy and you looked at sun when its cloudy it doesn t work like i told you and you consider me this before but there is no energy flowing from the sun to the solar panel through the wires to the motor for the flag to move over the motor to work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_011 it is not touching the one side which should be good and that s why the motor is not working
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_030 it showing that energy is going through this wires to the its like middle and it makes this flag move for the motor work also it needs to be on the negative side and the positive side and it needs to be touching the motor in order for the flag to move in the motor to work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_013 because the wires are the wire like the wire is touching the middle part and this middle part will touch the switch so that this the energy travels to it to the battery and back to the motor
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_023 if the sun is not shining it won t work because then there is no energy coming down to the solar panel to make the light
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_018 it doesn t work and it doesn t but the wires touch it so the motor can work and yes i have possess was right
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_022 energy is going from the solar panel through the wires to it so that it can work its processing energy from to the motor so that it will work
myst_007077_2014-02-11_13-20-24_EE_1.2_005 it means that the motor is working in it s the energy is making it move
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_009 they attached to the light bulb and each one as to go if you are using two each one has to go in a side so that it will light the light bulb up
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_011 electricity or energy
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_019 the electricity is going to the light bulb and around the little lines and with the filament is and then it is going back to the battery and i think that s kind of burning of the energy
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_032 if the wires are connected to the light bulbs and the battery it won t work because the little way electricity blue dots are flowing to it and there will be no other way for it to flow to the light bulb
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_015 in the light bulb there is something called the filament in the filament helps it light up
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_024 the blue dots represent the electricity
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_004 when the wires are attached to the battery and attached to the light bulb they make the light bulb lighter
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_031 that s the blue dots go all the way through everything and all the energy and electricity is just going through everything in like a cycle
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_027 it goes back the way thaen it started
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_003 they are close to make a circuit
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_017 when it does this i think there is electricity so then we can have light
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_012 they carry energy or electricity so that it makes so light bulb light up
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_007 it helps the energy go to the light bulb and that s kind of like the battery for the light bulb
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_029 the negative side
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_002 we have been learning about what is needed to lighter light bulb
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_013 when a wire when the wires are put on both sides of the d cell battery and put on to the light bulb the light bulb will light up after that
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_026 it turned around and the electricity started flowing out of the negative side into the positive side
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_005 we would take the wires put one on each side and then put one both of them on a light bulb to make it work and we would like push it on their so they it would really work
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_008 it is an energy source
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_033 it might go faster or they would both hit the bottom of it and it might light up or may not
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_014 the light bulb here on is for the wires and the batteries so they will light up
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_023 it comes towards the light bulb and then it comes towards the wire and comes down towards the battery
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_030 the battery is at the bottom and the wires are connected to i into the light bulb and the wire is one wire is connected to the side of light bulb and one is connected to the bottom and both of them are connected to the battery so that will light it up
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_016 it receives all the energy
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_020 it goes to the battery and into the wire and into the wire it goes to the light bulb so it lights up
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_025 the electricity blue dots are going to the positive side of the battery
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_010 they are a path way from the battery which is the source energy source and to the light bulb to make a lighter
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_006 they are pretty much to energy that makes the light bulb glow on and the wires that hit it
myst_007077_2014-02-04_12-58-01_EE_1.1_022 the electricity is coming from the negative side and into the light bulb and then i hope from the light bulb its going into the positive side
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_010 the thing that is conduct electricity or all metal and the things it don t conduct electricity which are insulators don t work they don t make the motor run
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_002 we have been learning about conductors and insulators
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_007 make an open circuit because that means it works right
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_003 i see that the generated flag is moving because the switch is not turned like to where it would be on
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_009 when i use to screen it works and like when i use like the metal things like the washers and the paper clip and the paper holder and the nail or the screw it works but when i use to the rock to rocks the sponge or the straw or the it didn t work
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_005 when you add an conductor the circuit works but when you don t when you add an insulator it doesn t work
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_015 conductors make things work like ah for example there is metal and it makes the generator work on the motor
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_008 when you use conductor it makes that energy will energy will i missed up sorry when a conductor is there it will make the motor or generator work
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_011 the circuit is complete because this wooden stick is not metal and it doesn t have a metal to it so it will make the generator move or the motor work or same difference you know marnie
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_012 it is not working and it is probably an insulator because it is not making the motor move like them the flag on the motor is moving
myst_007077_2014-02-25_13-26-11_EE_1.3_014 objects that are insulators don t work
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_017 okay i did that marnie now what would you like me to
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_009 okay marnie the circuit is the whole thing connected and the pathways are the wires
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_003 a circuit is like you could make the light bulbs light up with like the wire and the battery
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_002 we have been building series circuits and it our question was how can you get two bulbs to light at the same time with like it was kind of like with just a circuit with one light bulb one battery and the wires that s all it was except it had two batteries and multiple wires and two bulbs
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_005 the wires have to be connected to the d cell battery so then they are connected to the light bulb so the light bulb can light because then you are using like the battery is like a motor
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_010 the electricity from the battery goes through the wire to the light bulb to make
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_001 good how are you
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_020 when you add a d cell both of them are really bright and work
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_014 it is energy going through the electric battery and through the wire through the light bulbs
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_012 electricity goes through the battery and through the light bulbs and like through the wires and it just keeps going and going and going and going
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_024 yes and what it would like when you add another d cell the lights the bulbs or lights got very bright
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_013 the blue dots are the little energy the energy
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_023 you on the one d cell that lights are not bright at all but on the two d cells the lights are really really bright
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_021 when you take a battery aw away it is then light bulbs are not as bright
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_019 you will need more supplies you will need more wires and more batteries describe the problem when you made a series circuit using two bulbs and a d cell and we switched
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_007 idk the electricity helps the light light up okay
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_006 okay well in the electricity like the electricity flows from the battery through the wires and into the light to make it light
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-14-53_EE_2.1_018 usually one or two or more
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_005 i see two bulbs and one d cell
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_010 series circuits parallel circuits and series parallel and i am missing one which one i don t remember the other one
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_017 in the bottom right there is two d cells and one is connected to the positive side and the negative side and the out is the wires and the wires over the negative side and i see that they the lights are keep lighting but on the left side there is still it s kind of like that but it burns out really quickly
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_008 one bulb you can see the little energy is going just right on the silver part and then one you can see going like well the one with on the silver part in the filam over around the filament and one just around the filament
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_009 in a parallel circuit the bulbs are way brighter but in the series circuit it is very the lights are very dim
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_001 good how are you
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_007 when i roll over the top one the bigger one it has its own pathway and then when i go down to the second one and click on that one it shows me that one is that one is own pathway
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_004 the lights are lighting very brightly
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_016 well on the negative side of the d cell the pathway can go there and negative side of the d cell can go there also the like the pathway and then they go to the light bulbs and then it just goes and goes and goes and goes and goes around and around and around in like a cycle so that the light bulbs can just be bright like in a parallel circuit
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_014 they are all going in the same direction through the positive side out the negative side but that does not have to do anything but when they run if let us say the one battery one batter had one wire switched then they would just run into each other and be like well what is going on
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_012 in a parallel circuit the lights could be brighter and maybe if you add if you add something it will probably get dimmer to make a series circuit but in the series circuit like in when you add something they get it just keeps getting dimmer and dimmer but when you take away something in the series circuit that means that there is it will be brighter
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_011 the lights will probably get maybe a little less bright or a lot bright
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_015 well i see two like some pathways are big some pathways are small but this they are all connected like one is connected to one light bulb and the other light bulb well actually twenty-one to the side and the side and the bottom and the bottom and then one is connected to the side and to the positive side one is connected to the negative side and the bottom of that
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_003 it is a parallel circuit
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_020 i just told you
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_019 i just told you but i ll tell you again because the one is not connect both are not connected one pathway isn t connected on both sides to the negative side and both are connected to the bottom that should be connected to the positive side i just said that
myst_007077_2014-03-20_13-14-02_EE_2.2_002 we have been learning about magnets
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_024 with two d cells it goes brighter but once the one light but gets taken away the other light bulb doesn t work
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_006 the wires have to be connected to the the
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_021 if we had more than one d cell the bulbs will light brighter
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_008 the pathway is the the wires and the energy flows through that like to the wire from the d cell through the wire to the light bulb
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_023 i see that some of the time the bulb gets taken away it is different
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_009 the pathway is part of the circuit
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_003 it has like it produces energy
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_026 when you flip the d cell and the positive side is hitting the negative side then the electricity flows but when you click it and the negative sides are touching each other it doesn t work anymore
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_007 the wires can like the wires are the pathway and then the d cell is like the whole like electric corridor thing and then like when those are all combined and they hit the light bulb it lights
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_015 it flows through the wires and through the bulb and through the d cell through the and the negative side
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_027 the d cells when the bulbs the d cells are not like touching the and the negative side but when you click it again and it is not lighting then you can not really do anything because it is not working
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_004 i do not know it is like the electricity flows the wires
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_011 the pathway or the wires or both they both mean the same thing
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_025 because it because the electricity is just going through the negative sides and not the positive
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_012 well it goes through the positive side of the battery and then through the negative side through the wire through the light bulbs and just keeps going and going and going and going
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_013 the blue dots are the little dots of electricity
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_014 electricity is going like tup tup tup tup tup tup through the like little pizzas of electricity going through everything
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_018 two or more
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_010 the electricity can go through the pathway and it moves like through the light bulb
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_002 we have been building series circuits
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_022 they are all making more energy going through like it s kind of like a motor the motor gives the bulbs to light pretty much
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_020 when you add a d cell the bulbs get lighter when you take away a d cell the bulbs go like really light not bright
myst_007077_2014-03-12_09-34-16_EE_2.1_019 you will have to add more components like another battery and more wires
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_006 this is the candle and it s like it the warm we did a hand rubbing
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_016 a person is being on drums
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_018 it is making sounds
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_026 like it will give heat and everything to houses and people so that they can be warm
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_024 it smells like gas and it like start it starts to smell like gas and it doesn t smell very good
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_015 it is light and its will its lighting and you can see the it s really hot because it s like you could see that its melting
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_007 the heat is making the it s so hot and it makes the wax melt it s like a car when you go it burnt of the gas
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_022 i see wood fuel like gasoline i see a candle and three apples
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_010 that gas or the wax is like going down because the heat is like making it so hot that then wax melts
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_027 it doesn t do anything it just like help your home it just helps your home
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_014 yes this is burning after heat and when so here she is running or run off food and this one running of this candle is running of heat because the flame is lighting it and then makes heat running after
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_009 i think when i went buy it or i can see it s like hot
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_003 i have been learning about the presence of energy
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_017 you can tell because she is eating food she is eating an apple
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_023 when you use coal that makes like fire for an engine to run like a chain when you use gasoline that s for like fire and stuff like that and so is wood and then apples are helping you burn off your own energy and satellites give like they are it s for like heat and everything and then the windmill gives like you heat in like some places because it moves and gets that energy goes flowing to your house
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_020 she is doing walking and like a movement energy and she can makes noise if she steps on rock and she is walking off or unning or whatever she is doing off with the energy with because her food
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_013 there was no sound there was no sound not at all
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_025 it starts well when you are in a car it burns off the energy but like when sometimes when you get like new gas it smells like gas because you just got gla gas
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_004 it s important because it can heat like we did stations and we did and that was like heat heat happens new rub their hands together and when it s like a heat energy keeps your heater warm so you can stay heated in the winter or your air conditioner keeps this cold airs on you in the summer time
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_019 she is walking and she is like she is going off of her food or apple she is going really fast because she is like zero i am eating an apple and i need to burn off that energy it gives her energy
myst_007077_2014-03-06_14-03-29_EE_1.4_021 they are green apple
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_018 one mixture with more powder in it would taste more sweet and slightly sour compared to one with only a couple or less things of grape
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_003 solutions are two or more things mixed together
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_015 it is more diluted
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_021 we can add more water
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_019 it would taste less flavorful and grape
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_002 we have been studying mixtures and solutions and learning how to separate them
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_010 well today we used weight in our experiment we also used taste and we also used something else i can not
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_020 i think we can change the concentration of the by either adding or taking away more of the stuff that is inside it
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_013 i can tell by looking at the darker colored cups that they have more stuff in it purple stuff
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_011 one has more powder and one has less
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_017 we did this in class and it must taste very very sweet and slightly sour and very very very full if it is with the grape fantastic
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_012 the darker colored solutions has more grape stuff in it and the ones with less color had less grape stuff in it
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_016 each mixture has fifty millimeters of water and the first one which is the darker has five spoonfuls of grape powder and the one with less is only one spoonful and they both are a part of the drink mix
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_006 well there are many ways marni first you can tell it by taste second you can tell it by how it looks and third you can also tell it by weight but that one is not that smart so i will not
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_022 bye marni it has been really good talking to you too later
myst_014019_2014-01-13_13-45-00_MX_2.1_007 the one with more grape in it has little tiny blue dot things in it and so does the one with less purple stuff in it but the one with more purple stuff in it has more big cubes of purple and the other one has less big cubes of purple
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_014 all these different things either weigh ten grams or twenty grams when they are mixed together they create fifty grams and when they are mixed together all the different kinds of things are mixed together so they are not in their own unique pile
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_036 you can let it evaporate you could pick it out by hand
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_042 is the little tiny grains of salt and this is very important marney because this is the only way you can separate salt from water
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_019 the mass is increasing
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_029 i think this means that if you want to separate it you have to let it evaporate for a long period of time until the salt is separated and left in the container and the water evaporates
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_007 the sand and in the sand and water mixture the sand stays at the bottom and you can see it and in the salt and water experiment you it dissolves and you can not see it
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_037 here one type of liquid i am guessing that it is salt is mixed with water and then when you mix it together it it like what happens is is with nothing but salt crystals
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_041 you could let it evaporate
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_004 i think the salt will dissolve in the water
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_032 that means it is a mixture
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_018 ten grams twenty grams twenty grams again equals fifty grams that is what this picture shows i am done
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_034 i think it is a solution
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_046 thanks marney i had a lot of fun with you too i can not wait to see you again in a little bit
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_039 it is evaporating
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_016 that when you mix two things together they create a bigger mass or weight
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_012 the salt is the solvent and when it is poured into the water it creates a mixture
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_025 here the flour is being added to the water and when it is the water the water gets poured down a filter the water goes through it and onto the bottom and and the rest of the flour stays on the top in the coffee filter
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_017 that when you mix two things together it will create a different weight
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_045 sure marney so what we talked about was today is about mixtures and solutions we took some normal mixtures and solutions talked about how much they weigh and what happens when they are mixed together we also talked about in my opinion the best of all was when you take salt and water mix it together then you let the water evaporate and you are only left with salt crystals
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_015 the water weighs fifty grams and the salt weighs fifteen grams when you add them together and it weighs sixty-five grams
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_022 one kind of grams one kind of gram equals gram together
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_020 i see that when you pour one thing into a cup and then use a scale for it and then you get some gram cubes and you put them in the other cup you can create a way that is equal or about equal and when you put another thing added to the mixture you need more gram cubes to equal that
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_003 that water plus different materials make a solution
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_002 we have been doing mixtures and solutions
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_006 what is happening here is that different things are mixed with water and making solutions
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_028 i know that notice that salt is being mixed with water and then it is poured down a coffee filter and the water goes down into the bottom of the thing and then and then the salt instead of staying at the top with the coffee filter it goes down with the water
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_043 i notice that when you put your things together and you leave them there the salt stays and the water disappears
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_024 there are many ways you can do that you can let the thing evaporate you could you could take it apart with a screen you could use a you could just use your hands
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_011 here the salt can be dissolved into the water but the water can not be dissolved in the salt
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_040 i think with salt this is the only way to separate them because you can not pick it up by hand a filter does not work all you can do is let it evaporate
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_021 what is happening in this picture marney is when you add water to salt or salt to water it creates a salt water mixture and the water weighs fifty grams the salt weighs fifteen grams and that together equals sixty-five grams
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_009 the water is the thing that the is that the thing is being dissolved into
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_033 i notice that the citric acid is being poured into the water and then you take that and you put it through the filter and then once you are done you can clearly see that all goes down and stays in the in the bucket below there is nothing left in the coffee filter this is called a solution
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_038 this is called evaporation marney when you mix salt and water together then you pour it into a thing and you leave it there for a while the water will evaporate into the air and the and the salt crystals will stay in there and that is how you can separate them once and for all
myst_014019_2013-12-18_12-27-32_MX_1.2_008 the salt dissolved in the water and this is important because that is how you make a mixture
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_003 one of them has grape mix in them and one of them has a water solution in them a salt water solution in them
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_008 when you put the rock in sorry when you put the feather in it is lighter and it is heavier than normal air but when you put the rock in it is heavier than the feather but when you take the rock out the feather is heavier again to air
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_014 by doing gram adding
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_018 one is the least concentrated two is the least concentrated and three is in the middle
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_021 bye marni it was really good talking to you too bye bye
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_017 you can do many things you can pour them into a thingy and let them evaporate you could you could put them through a filter and see how much stuff is left actually scratch that just let them evaporate
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_009 they both have seventy-five milliliters of water but one of them has ten grams of solute and another has twenty grams of solute
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_002 we have been working on mixtures and solution and how to tell the mass of them especially ones you can not see
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_012 i found out that that that my prediction was correct the one with twenty grams of solute weighed a bit more than the one with ten grams
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_020 i think number one is most concentrated and number two is a least concentrated
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_019 one is most concentrated two is least concentrated and three is in the middle
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_007 the feather weighs two grams and the rock weighs ninety grams so when you put them on a scale together the feather is lighter and the rock is heavier
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_005 you can tell a solution is concentrated when it has a different color
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_011 i think the one with twenty grams of solute will weigh more because it has more solute and the other one has less
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_016 i can tell you that with the salt water solution you do not notice the difference between all three glasses but with the grape mix one has one is darker one is in the middle and one is less purple
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_013 because one has more solute and and one has less solute they both have seventy-five milliliters of water but the one that has more it will naturally weigh more
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_010 one has more solute and one has less
myst_014019_2014-01-15_12-31-39_MX_2.2_004 you could tell how concentrated they are by the color of them the taste of them or how much they weigh in the grape drink mix the one that has less powder is the one lighter and the one that has more powder is darker
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_017 this is important because when you mix two things together you you can put it through like a coffee filter and stuff and then the water will stay at the bottom and then like the mud or something will stay in the coffee filter and it will not go down
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_029 i think we could because everything can be like separated from a solution or a mixture
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_014 what is happening is when you have a mixture of water and marbles and you put and you have a bowl and a screen on top the water will go through the screen on top the water will go through the screen but the marbles are too big to so they will stay on the top and this is how you separate some types of mixtures
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_019 when you mix two different things together mud and water for instance and you pour it through this the filter has a very important role because while the water drains down it keeps one thing at the top and then they are separated
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_004 they are all mixtures
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_007 the piles on the right are all the different all the same and the one on the left has all of that different kinds mixed together
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_028 it is called water
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_025 the salt will get dissolved into the water and this mixture is important because there is
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_003 the salad has many thing mixed into it one of the cups has a bunch of different things in it like paper clips and sand paper and then there is a pile of like jelly beans and normal beans these are all mixtures
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_012 what is happening here is all the different parts of the mixture are separating into their own unique pile and this is important because when it is when they are all in their unique pile instead of in one altogether it is no longer a mixture
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_022 it is a solution
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_005 the salad has many different kinds of fruits and vegetables in it and the marbles have like a different color swirl inside and i am talk
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_010 all the different kinds of things in the trail mix separate and that is important because it is no longer a mixture
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_018 this is called a filter and it is it is purpose is to separate different types of mixtures while one thing stays at the top the water rushed down and it stays at the bottom in the cup and what we have been learning so far is that there are different kinds of mixtures to separate like different kinds stuff and that and yeah
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_002 we have been doing a lot of experiments about mixtures and solutions
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_011 all of the different parts of the trail mix are separating into their own pile and each pile only has it is like shape and texture and it
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_015 the water is sinking to the bottom of the cup and the marbles are staying on top
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_008 it is called a mixture
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_030 the difference between mixtures and solutions is that mixtures is when one or more is when multiple things are mixed together and they are able to be separated and a solution is where multiple things are not able to be separated
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_016 the screen is very important because well water can go through the screen and stay in the bowl the marbles are too big and so they stay on top
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_021 it began as two different kinds of things but when you mixed it together the salts the salt like became one with the mixture and it is now dissolved into the water
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_026 the salt will was dissolved into the water
myst_014019_2013-12-16_13-44-19_MX_1.1_023 the properties of salt is that it is able to dissolve into water and when it is finished it leaves it leaves no trace that it was ever there in the water
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_009 the one on the right has two the one on the left has five so the one on the left has way more than the right
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_018 the left has less
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_010 i do not know
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_016 the one the ones on the right is darker the middle has almost the same and the two the two on the left has less
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_017 i do not know okay
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_003 you are mixing more grape grape with water
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_007 the eleven on the right has less the one on the left has way more than the right
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_020 better than the right
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_012 you weighed it and the one with the with the most is concentrated i think
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_013 how much spoons how much spoonfuls you have
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_022 it would taste worse cause it tastes like water okay
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_008 the one on the left has five of them five of them
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_023 it it it will not taste that good
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_025 you can take the water out
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_027 please please can we just move on
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_019 you you use from the left you use five spoonfuls and on the right you use one spoonful
myst_019007_2014-02-19_11-18-28_MX_2.1_021 the less the less the water you use more i mean more the grape stuff you use the better it tastes the less if the less if it tastes tastes cause it tastes like water
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_033 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_013 well i took the electromagnet is picking up a a whole bunch of magnets
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_024 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_045 it will be like twenty i am not too sure about
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_023 it picks up more wa washers
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_047 well i went to where the ninety-five would be on the graph and then i went over and it looked like it would be on fifteen
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_032 cause maybe because more electricity flows through it
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_027 you can wrap a wire around it
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_002 electromagnets are magnets that where if you touch another metal thing or steel thing then they become a wait
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_038 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_035 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_005 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_028 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_014 well i think it means that the wire round the winds around the thing the electromagnet like a one hundred times
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_017 it gets stronger and it picks up more magnets
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_020 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_026 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_016 the less wraps there are the less washers it picks up
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014 the blue dots is the energy or the electricity going through the wire then going through the light bulb then coming back through the battery
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_016 i think the flow goes through one battery but since there is two wires that go to only one battery and then on the other side there is another two wires that go to the other batter so they each get their own like amount of electricity so that is why they are brighter
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_010 well since these ones do not have their own source of electricity thing going in and then coming back to it it is not it is dimmer
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019 the electricity goes back into the d cell on the plus side
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_028 it means it has two pathways
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_023 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_021 well each light bulb has it is own pathway and then it keeps going through that pathway and then the other side of the light bulb s still has it is own pathway
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011 the one in the parallel circuit is brighter
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018 well the electricity will it goes like goes into the and then like moves away from the minus
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_009 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_002 we have been doing stuff with electricity
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_013 i do not remember anything
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_025 i think it represents that th the battery and then the wires going through the light bulb and then yeah i think it represents a maybe like a parallel circu
myst_997670_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_024 two symbols on the side equal light bulbs and then the two symbols in the middle equal a battery
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_026 they are all steel or aluminum
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_006 ers are things that stick to magnets i think
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_023 the motor starts running
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_024 the motor is not running
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_028 well only saint well steel can get picked up by a magnet but aluminum it can not
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_015 steel and aluminum
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_012 all the steel and aluma thing aluminum things that are touching the switch and also touching the thing where the switch should touch make the motor spin
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_029 they are all steel
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014 most of em are made from steel some of em are aluminum though
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_020 insulators are anything that is not steel
myst_997670_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_017 they are all not steel or aluminum
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_009 i can not explain it
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_026 the wires are taking power from the d cell pretty much and then it is giving the power to the light bulb
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_025 zero well what is happening is well the d cell is pretty much touching the light bulb pretty much giving it electricity plus the wires is making it light light up
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_039 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_041 one is touching the bottom and the other is touching the side and that is why it is lighting on all the other ones in the first picture both of the wires are touching the bottom that is why it will not light in the second picture only one of there is only one wire and that is touching the bottom in the third picture they are both touching the side so it will not light but if you have one touching the bottom and one touching the side it will light
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_021 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_043 well one needs to touch on the bottom one needs to touch on the side else the light bulb will not turn on
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002 it is going really good i mean pretty good
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_031 i think it might be like electricity but i am not sure
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_004 there is a battery a two wires and a blue thingy i do not know what that is and then the red thing i do not really know what it is and then there is a light bulb that you put on the red thing and you are tr
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_035 i do not really know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_022 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_027 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_018 kind of like a well how the d cell is electricity if you put the wires on it it is pretty much a it is kind of like a road that like goes and then like if you connect it to the light bulb then th it is like the road is leading to there of the like it is like a road of electricity kinda
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_019 it tears like the electricity
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_005 well if you put the wires on the wait i forgot sorry
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_040 well you have to touch the wi one of the wires to the bottom of the light bulb and one to the side of the light bulb else it will not light
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_033 it looks like the electricity is kind of going from the magnet i mean the d cell to the light bulb and then coming from the light bulb and it keeps going around to the d cells and back through then back to the light bulb then going back to the d cell pretty much
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_008 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_003 i forgot what i i forgot what i was doing in science
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_011 well battery is kind of like you can like plug em into things and it will li it is pretty much electricity well it is electricity that and it kind a hel makes things work
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_044 we zero i do not really know actually
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_032 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_048 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_036 it it is where you connect the wires to the d cell and yeah
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_023 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_012 well if you put the two wires on the d cell and then you touch the the other ends pf the two wires together it can make the light bulb light up
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_024 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_045 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_037 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_042 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_016 well if you put like wires in a circuit zero i forgot
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_020 a circuit can if you attach wires to the circuit the circuit can make the light bulb much light like light up
myst_997670_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_046 i do not know i think it is may be a er i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_035 bottom it is pretty it is a light bulb i mean a a d cell battery or a battery on the top it is a light bulb
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_023 when the switch is closed the motor is spinning when the switch is open the motor stops spinning
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_016 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_029 i can not tell what it is
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_020 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 well what is happening is when you click it it is making it shows the motor spin but when you click it again then it is not spinning anymore
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_036 l the thing on the bottom that is is a motor and then the black lines are wires
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019 the switch is touching the metal the metal is touching the wire pretty much so yeah
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005 well the d cell kind of is like the is the electric source pretty much
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_034 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_022 the motor is spinning
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002 well we were like doing this thing where we had to make a motor run
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_032 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_006 the d cell is the source
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_031 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017 well the wires touch the switch pretty much and that makes it so the switch pretty much turns it makes like you know well the motor will spin when the wires are touching it or when the electricity is going through it and stuff but if the if the switch is not on then it will not go but then if the switch is on then it makes it go pretty much
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008 it provides the electricity pretty much
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_009 the wires pretty much connect like they are kind of like well the d cell well you put it on the d cell to make s something like like make a light bulb light or make the motor s spin and stuff and yeah
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_039 which i think i think there is like a switch
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003 well we used to a wire a d cell battery a motor and a little platform and then a switch
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015 well it is spinning cause the d cell is giving electricity to the wires and the wires are putting the electricity in the motor
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_026 well the wires have to be touching the battery and it has to be touching the motor
myst_997670_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 i think it is like it receives all the energy or lec or electricity pretty much i think
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_017 i do not know that
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011 what is happening is that it is too thick so the magnets will not stick but when you add one washer the washer is heavier than the magnet so then it the left side i mean the right side is heavier
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_019 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_018 i do not really know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_027 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_028 i do not know that i can not observe anything what
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_016 magnet are not really sticking i think cause there is s so many spacers
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009 well what is happening is the one with the magnet in it is sticking to the other magnet through the cup but then when you add nineteen washers it is breaking the magnetic force pretty much
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005 i do not know what we did cause i was not here for science
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_010 that i do not really know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_014 i can not explain it and i do not really know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006 i did not find out anything cause i was not here today
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_012 i do not i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_030 i do not i can not figure that out i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_013 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_003 i was not here for science today so i do not know
myst_997670_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_008 it connects to these i think they are brass things or they might be steel
myst_997670_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_012 it is a wire inside of the mystery boar
myst_997670_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_010 well it is touching the wires because the wires are touching the little gold thing on top
myst_997670_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_006 you try to p you put wires on it and a motor and you try to figure out where the wires are
myst_997670_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_009 well it is a light bulb and a battery and then there is two wi then there is two ends of the wires and i think you are well you have to touch em to like a and something a and a different letter or b and a different lo well you have to touch it to li two letters and try to figure out where the wire is
myst_997670_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_020 well there is two well there is wires inside the board one wire is touching the a gold thing the other part of the wire is touching the c so if you touch the two parts of the the wire that is not inside of it on those two things then it makes it light up
myst_997670_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_004 there was boards that you like put stuff on and it like so you do not have to put it on your desk
myst_997670_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_007 there is a wire connected to d and a
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_045 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_049 they light bulbs l like are brighter when you when there is two batteries but they are dimmer when there is only one
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_011 they are both lit
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_042 well when it is when the one way th the energy is going around in a circle clockwise but if you switch it the other way it is going counterclockwise
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_015 well the electricity is going through the wires then it is going through the light bulb then it is going through another light bulb then it is going back
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_050 es it makes the light bulbs lighter
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_044 well it is starting well the electricity is the energy is going f is going out of the negative side going through the light bulb then going through the other light bulb then coming through going through the positive side coming out the negative side and going through the positin then going back through the negative
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_007 well the circuit is like i forgot what a circuit was
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_043 the side that does not have a bump
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_002 we have been trying to make light bulbs light with t two light bulbs light with four wires and one battery
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_013 zero in the one where there only one light bulb it is lighter because it is u it is taking all the energy but in the second one it is giving some of the energy to the other one too
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_057 i do not know bye
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_051 zero when the two positive sides are touching nothing happens but when a and negative side are touching the energy starts up again
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_016 the blue dots are electricity i think
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_054 that if two positive sides are touching then nothing will happen but if two negative but if a and a negative side are touching it the electricity will work
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_039 the electricity flows out from the d cell i th
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_053 i do not know
myst_997670_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_004 well the two wires are touching the light b the d cell and then the two wires are also touching the light bulb that is making the light bulb light
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_024 well the magnet with the n if the side that has n on it and the side that have s on it come together then they will stick but if the but if the side that has n and then the other one on the other side has an n on it they will not stick it is the same thing with two s is but if an s and an n comes together then they will stick
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_015 i can not think of anything
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_021 the magnet is sticking to the one but then the other well there is one side and if you flip the magnet over then one of the sides will not stick
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_019 well the magnet is sticking and then the magnet is not sticking to the to the same magnet for some reason
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_022 well the magnet is i can not remember anymore
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_004 i have got it to wor
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_014 i can not think of anything else
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_009 we have been studying about magnetic stuff
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_006 yes i do
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_023 i can not think of anything
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_016 magnet was not sticking and cause that cause the scroll thingy was not that aluminum nail was aluminum and magnets do not stick to aluminum and then it stuck to the steel nail because magnets stick to steel
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_017 magnets stick to like steel mostly steel
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_025 well the s and the n will stick together but if two n is come together then and an s if two n is or two s is come together then either will not stick but if an s and n come together then it will stick
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_010 we have been seeing if magnets stick on stuff
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_002 what are you doing how have you been
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_011 paper clips and
myst_997670_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_018 i observed like a lo i observed a my desk my chair and most of us and a few other things that i can not remember the names of
myst_997494_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_026 sorry marnie i have to go
myst_997494_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_005 to make two light bulbs work instead of one light bulb with one battery
myst_997494_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018 the electricity is going through the bottom and coming out the side
myst_997494_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003 the light bulbs are sharing the electricity
myst_997494_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_002 we have been learning about parallel circuits
myst_997494_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_004 i see a parallel circuit they are sharing they are sharing the electricity with and negative
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_004 because we are working on living systems
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_007 repeat that question
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_012 repeat the question please
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_011 because of the water and land
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_017 i do not get that question
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_020 like the blue arrow is what they do eat and then the red arrow is what i really do not know what the red arrow is
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_016 it has to do with the it it because of how all the animals are in certain places and if that place is not a the a the right right enough for the animals will die
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_008 because of all the other all the different parts it has
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_014 there are four
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_009 because of how it has like the the arms the head those are all different types of parts
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_006 because human bodies are systems too
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_010 repeat repeat the question
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_021 it is just like the food chain
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_013 it shows the layers and the little hill and shows like all the stuff underwater and buildings
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_019 just of like how all the where all the animals are like all the animals that most of the animals that live there and type of food and trees and humans sometimes
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_015 biosphere is all about like animals and humans and birds that are on living on earth
myst_022211_2014-11-13_11-38-53_LS_1.1_005 because of how all the system the a car has with other thing
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_012 hawk and snake
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_006 repeat the same question that you exactly just said instead of giving me a different question okay okay
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_005 say that question again i did not hear you very good
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_007 it makes them producers by like they let us see i do not really know
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_010 a consumer is something that eats a eats like eats like a fish like a bear that eats living things basically
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_014 say the exact question you just said you are a speaking robot
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_001 i am good
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_002 the food chain
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_003 it has to do with like the food chain because like the food chain is how what what something eats another thing which eats another thing which is the picture you just showed to me
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_013 ate it eat it eats decomposers are things that eat dead things yup
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_004 because when like a bear eats a fish a fish eats a smaller fish
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_011 what was that
myst_022211_2014-12-01_12-00-03_LS_1.3_008 the two parts that are at the bottom of the picture
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-42-17_LS_1.1_003 it is all a system
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-42-17_LS_1.1_008 because it is a system with a bunch of bunch of different subsystems
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-42-17_LS_1.1_009 because it is a system and it has lots of other lots of other subsystems
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-42-17_LS_1.1_006 because these systems are a subsystem or a system
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-42-17_LS_1.1_004 because all the pictures that you are showing are a system
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-42-17_LS_1.1_005 because a car is a system
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-42-17_LS_1.1_002 the digestive system
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-42-17_LS_1.1_007 because the system has subsystems
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_012 because it is one a circulatory system
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_004 they both have a digestive system and
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_007 all the circulatory systems that is inside of you you need to have so you can live
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_013 blood blood heart and your blood cells
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_017 help you stay alive
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_015 your heart is pumping blood
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_008 cells are being brought into the body
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_016 they are the blood it blood vessels are blood that goes in your heart and then comes out
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_014 it pumps blood so you can live
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_003 repeat the stinking question
myst_022211_2015-01-15_11-47-04_LS_3.4_006 that the heart is one giant system
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_007 like so the the wires around the coil electricity has a magnetic field and when the wires are so close to the rivet it induces the magnetism
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_002 i have been learning about mirrors and how light can reflect off of them
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_026 the wires are wrapping around the rivet which is inducing magnetism in the rivet which is allowing the it to pick up the washer
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_027 iron or steel because those are the only thing besides magnets and magnetize that can pick up magnets
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_008 if the electricity is flowing around the rivet and it is actually going through then it will induce magnetism but if the switch is not there and it is not a complete circuit then nothing will happen until it is it is complete
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_014 uhm the rule of the switch is if it was not touching the metal thing which is the wire is near on the wire the circuit would not be complete nothing would be happening the electricity would be stopping short of the rivet
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_017 when i clicked on the switch the first time the the washers flew up and when i clicked on it the second time they flew back down
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_025 the wires have there has to be enough coils with the wire for it to induce magnetism
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_015 the switch if it is if it is straight and it is touching both sides of the metal then it is it is letting electricity go through if it is not then it is stopping the electricity
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_016 well if there is no flow of electricity that is probably because the switch is not connecting the whole circuit together
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_009 it induces magnetism because electricity has a magnetic field
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_020 all of the switch is important because it either opens stops the circuit or completes it
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_005 the wires wrapped around the rivet which induces electromagnetism which makes it all
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_012 well the wires important because it connects the circuit and also produces magnetism and the switch is important because it it it finishes the circuit which allows the circuit to move and the rivet is important because it is becoming electromagnet which is picking up the washers and the batteries are the d cell is important because it gives it electricity
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_024 well the pieces the blue circles represent electricity and i see them going around the coil and i see their flow
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_021 well i know a temporary magnet is a is not a permanent magnet it is just for the time being and an electromagnet is a is not a magnet until the well the magnetism is not when the magnetism is not induced then it is not an electromagnet
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_006 uhm it induces magnetism which makes the rivet an electromagnet which is a which allows it to pick up those washers
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_019 a closed switch is in an electromagnet which because an electromagnet is a is one also one of the things is that it can be turned on and off and with out the switch it could not be done that really easily
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_028 the because it is important because only iron and steel can in magnets in magnetite can pick up magnets because iron iron can pick up magnets steel is made out of iron and magnets are made out of magnetite only those objects can pick up magnets and washers and stuff
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_023 the the electricity is going through and around the coils around around the coils and then it is coming down back to the battery and so on and so on and it is picking up the the washers
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_010 there is there is tiny blue things of electricity flowing in the on the rivet which allows it to pick them up
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_011 there is a bunch of so the there is a lot of little pieces of electricity
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_003 uhm because it has to be complete circuit for the the electromagnetism to be induced
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_029 iron is one of the metals that that can pick up magnets and the the coils give it magnetism
myst_012201_2015-01-20_08-53-51_EE_4.1_013 has to be complete it has to be it there has to be a lot of coils around the rivet and the switch has to be down
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-03-16_EE_2.1_003 is a complete flow of electricity that goes from the battery around and back usually going through some stuff
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-03-16_EE_2.1_007 by uhm it is going through the negative the wire connected to the negative side through the light bulb and out the bottom to the positive
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-03-16_EE_2.1_005 it has to be complete circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-03-16_EE_2.1_006 uhm they are all important because they make a complete circuit together
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-03-16_EE_2.1_002 been learning about electromagnets and lights and mirrors
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-03-16_EE_2.1_004 uhm it is coming out of this negative side it is going through the wire through the light bulb out the bottom through the wires to the positive side it keeps on doing this there is nothing blocking it
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_017 uhm when one dies out the other one does not and when you click on that again it turns back on
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_009 the the other one burns out too
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_010 i think it may be a series circuit no uhm because it has it there is only one pathway
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_011 bulb is burned out so on the one stops burning
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_012 uhm when one bulb burns out then the flow of electricity is broken because there is there is nothing to replace it which makes it is the other not be able to flow so it runs out
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_018 uhm there is three light bulbs and all and if one and they each have a different pathway so if one burns out the other one does not
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_015 they have different pathways
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_019 the filament burns out
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_005 the light turns on
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_004 uhm there is a circuit but it is open because there is not a complete flow because the switch is open not closed
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_016 uhm when one of them burns out the flow of electricity for that one stops but then the other one does not burn out unlike the series circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_014 uhm when one bulb burns out the other does not burn because they are not sharing the same path of electricity
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_020 uhm maybe because the in the parallel circuit they do not have the same pathway when the series circuit they do have the same pathway so when one burns out all of them burn out
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_021 when one burns out the the other one does because they share the same flow
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_007 a parallel circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_024 because it is not a complete circuit anymore when one is burned out because there is a hole in the circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_002 been learning about mirrors lights filtering light and electromagnetic
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_025 we have talked about how one light bulb burns out in a series circuit the other one stops burning and one in a parallel circuit when one burns out they still keep on burning because they do not share the same pathway unlike the series circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-56-48_EE_2.3_008 uhm a string of light is a bunch of light in a series circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_010 the white light is hitting the blue wall and it is bouncing out as blue light
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_023 uhm i think the object that was not the same color as the filter would turn black when normally if it was the same color it would just be its normal color
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_017 the yellow ball it is they bounce off as yellow because every other color is being absorbed but yellow
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_026 some light the red and blue light will not will do not change the color but the green light will make it bright
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_027 it is the same color as dark dark green but when as for red and blue but green light it makes it just brighter
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_007 lights shining through a prism which is breaking the white light up into each color which are the colors of the rainbow
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_022 the note cards placed behind the filter it runs red but when the blue one is it still turns blue
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_029 green and blue light it just stays the same but for the red light it turn
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_024 the yellow ball when it is placed in the blue light it turns like yellow dark dark dark yellowish
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_013 uhm i think when the white light is hitting the ball every color but blue is getting absorbed into the ball and the blue is the only thing left so it bounces off as blue
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_002 learning about mirrors and lights and electromagnets
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_018 that not all of them that are hitting the ball are coming back
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_012 when the light hit the white light hits it every color but blue is absorbed so blue reflects out
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_020 well the light is going passing through the red light bulb it is filtering out every color but the red so red light goes through it
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_021 we have been talking about filtering light and the light is getting filtered by this red sheet
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_003 they are all have like this white bright things shining around them
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_025 just turned darker it did not black fully
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_009 it the white light shines through is white until it hits the prism where it turns to all the colors of the rainbow
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_028 because it is green i am guessing
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_014 it is the only color not getting absorbed by the blue ball
myst_012201_2015-01-26_08-50-16_EE_5.2_008 uhm there it is white light through to the prism and out it is the colors of the rainbow
myst_012201_2015-01-23_12-41-34_EE_5.1_003 light how you see things is light bounces off of them which and they bounces back to your eyes which allows you to see it
myst_012201_2015-01-23_12-41-34_EE_5.1_009 uhm when it hits the object it bounces back off
myst_012201_2015-01-23_12-41-34_EE_5.1_008 uhm i know that light bounces off some objects and sometimes it does and if it bounces off some it it bounces back to your eyes which allow you to see it
myst_012201_2015-01-23_12-41-34_EE_5.1_004 what it is showing light and it is bouncing back to the eyes and i was talking about is bouncing back to us
myst_012201_2015-01-23_12-41-34_EE_5.1_002 we have been learning about lights and mirrors
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_010 it is a parallel circuit because they each have their own pathways
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_012 this is parallel circuit because they each have their own pathway they have their own pathway they do not share it
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_004 is a series no parallel circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_008 it is a parallel circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_022 i know that the one on the right is takes a lot longer because to burn out because they are not using as much energy while on the left one it is using twice the amount of energy as the one on the right is
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_002 been learning about mirrors lights electromagnets and filtering lights
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_005 parallel circuit because each in a parallel circuit have each of the light bulbs have their own pathway same here
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_023 the series the parallel circuits are much brighter than the series circuits because they have their own pathway
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_015 i think it is still they would still be brighter
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_020 parallel circuit both light bulbs have their own path in the series circuit they share the same path also in the parallel circuit they they are brighter in the series circuit they are less bright
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_011 the series circuit shares the two light bulbs halfway so they are less bright the two on the top they have their own pathway so they are shining brighter
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_014 it gets brighter
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_016 uhm the the parallel circuits on the top are much much brighter than the series circuit on the bottom
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_017 uhm i think that the the series circuit if one thing is if one of the bulbs is shut off then the other one shuts off too but in a parallel circuit if one shuts off and the other one does not shut off
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_024 because they share the same electricity which makes them not get as much electricity as the parallel ones which have their own electricity they do not have to share
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_013 it is a parallel circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_009 uhm i think this circuit is a series circuit
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_021 the parallel circuit on the right lasts longer than the the one on the left
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_018 the energy is coming out of the negative side going through the wires to the light bulbs and out the wires through to back to the positive side of the battery
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_025 we covered uhm parallel circuits and how a parallel circuit with two light bulbs takes and two d cells burns takes longer to burn out than a one with two d cells in one
myst_012201_2015-01-26_09-44-15_EE_2.2_006 circuits share the same pathway while which makes them less bright well with these with a parallel circuit they are more bright because they have different pathways but that drains more energy
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_014 what is a liter beaker
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_023 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_035 a number s saying how many milliliters it is
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_020 it has it has two well the measuring tools and the one says one hundred and the other one says one thousand millimeters
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_021 we did not do the measurement was one thousand whatever
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_024 i have never actually used a milliliter
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_027 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_013 it is a liter
myst_996718_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_025 i do not know

myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_032 they there is a syringe a gra graduated a graduated cylinder and a liter
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_023 what did you say
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_034 sorry i could not hear you
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_025 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_026 really thought it was just it was telling you the volume of the can
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_015 to measure the weight inside or something not the weight ha the capacity or volume in something
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_014 drink it all and then spit it back in and and that is just a joke you could take out the soda with a syringe eleven by one thousand, one hundred and fifty by one hundred and fifty-one syringe at a time
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_043 they add up the last step for them is to add it up
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_045 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_004 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_017 s it is telling you how much soda is inside of it
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_013 blah blah blah that is what it is all about excuse me that is how you sound to me
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_016 it is not all the way to the top
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_031 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_006 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_035 they are telling you how like if you if you do not want to fill up all the way to one hundred milliliters and you want it just to be up to like fifty you could like fill up until it is was at fifteen
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_024 what did you say
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_028 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_042 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_019 what would you say
myst_996718_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_020 what did you say
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_006 i can not remember
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_015 what would you say
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_017 i forget what is called
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_033 capacity is basically volume i am guessing
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_035 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_032 i still do not understand what capacity is
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_013 it is a syringe
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_029 i do not know what capacity is
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_031 i do not know what capacity is
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_010 what did you say
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_045 if it is wide it will probably hold more the wider it is the more it holds and the taller it is and skinnier it is the lesser it will
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_023 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012 what would you say
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_007 m i forget what those things are
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_004 i do not really know what you mean by that
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_021 you measure stuff you measure the volume of stuff that
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_025 you can estimate
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_014 it is telling you how many milliliters are there
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_036 i do not really hear you
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_003 we are trying to figure out how much water will fit in the cup
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_039 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_034 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_020 it tells you it is basically like the syringe it tells you how many milliliters is in it
myst_996718_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_011 well we did not squirt it out of the cup we squirted it into the cup
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_033 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_036 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_015 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_003 metric system units
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_016 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_024 get more gram pieces
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_008 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_013 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_023 the orange is too heavy
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_027 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_039 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008 which one is the right
myst_996718_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_024 zero well you can three from your answer cause the wet sponge is three grams and then you will have your answer or you could just take a wet sponge squeeze out the water out of it and then put you can put in a different cup but then pour in and then just weigh the water
myst_996718_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_012 blank blank blank
myst_996718_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005 which one is the middle
myst_996718_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_021 it is sixteen grams
myst_996718_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004 which one is the left
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_005 no you did not repeat yourself
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_006 yes i do get that
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017 they were different si sizes so everyone got something different
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_021 everyone would get different answer so it would be real crazy it could be any number like twenty-two centimeters i mean twenty-two straws or forty-four straws or any any number
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_003 yes i do see the little below your head
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_023 marnie i have to go
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_010 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_012 you can use different units different tools you can use a yardstick a meter stick a ruler you can use units like cema cem centimeters yards meters feet inches
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_009 well we just started a new unit about measuring with the metric system and before that we were doing geometry
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_013 i do not know what length is all about
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_016 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_011 how long it is
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_020 i i am not exactly sure what you mean by that
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_008 yes i am ready
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_018 y everyone would get different lengths so it so it will not be that accurate and it will be better to use stuff straws the same size so it would like be all around one number
myst_996718_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_022 you could go back and use like a rul have like box straws and use box straws cause they are all the same length or you could use like a tape measure and measure it with the tape measure
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_027 some of them are the same lengths
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_017 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_006 that is a q that is a question i do not know the answer to that question
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_009 ma you measure it more than once cause you want to make sure that you got the right answer
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_026 they are almost the same lengths
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_032 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_002 you could use a yard stick a meter stick a rule a tape measure and there are different units you could use you could use inches centimeters meters or yards
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_015 no we measure we used a ruler and er arms spans we used a meter stick
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_034 i do not i do not know
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_001 good morning thank you for asking
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_016 a meter tape cause a meter stick can not bend and so a meter tape bends so it would be a lot easier
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_019 it is one centimeter wide
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_010 so you cause you want to make sure you got the right answer cause right here he did not the you did not get the right answer cause it is not straight
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_024 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_033 me do not know
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_031 you could measure how long a a key like the key on a keyboard is or the spacebar or any or something like that
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_022 we measured around our neck we measured around our upper arm we measured our height we measured our wi our wingspan that is pretty much it
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_008 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_025 the they are both the same lengths
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_013 we measured how er how long our nose is how long our ear is from your wrist to your elbow from your head to your knee and from your knee to the floor
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_003 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_023 well our height and our wingspan were not exactly the same but they are pretty darn by but any and my nose and my ear they are only two centimeters apart and my wingspan and my and my length length was ten centi centimeters apart
myst_996718_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_005 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010 what they were made of may be
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_005 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_006 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_017 i do not really know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_026 i you could put like one paper clip in and it will like it will get a little bit lower and you could keep on doing that until it is even
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_040 i i do not know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_032 it is showing a cube and it is saying it equals one gram
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_009 what they are made of probably cause metal is a lot heavier than plastic and it can get very cold sometimes plastic can not get that cold plastic can not change temperatures
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_042 bye too bye bye
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_011 y you could estimate which one is heavier like i thought the metal the metal chip is heaviest then the one the one wooden block is the second heaviest and the chip is lightest
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_021 i i do not know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_034 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_038 it is balanced like it is like in the middle the li the white lines th in the middle
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008 cause they are made out of different materials
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_031 i do not really understand what you are saying
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_018 you are trying to see how many paper clips the plastic chip is
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_016 like like if i knew that the metal chip was like ten gr ten paper clips i could estimate that the plastic chip was lower was lighter than ten paper clips that is what you could do i think
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_001 i am good thank you
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_027 i do not know one is bigger than the other
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_019 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_028 use mass which is a which which we mass is like this unit in the in the metric system uses
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_014 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_015 you want to see how much which one is heavier
myst_996718_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_033 you could measure an earring you could measure a necklace you could weigh you could weigh a bracelet you could you could weigh a ring
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_007 i do not know why
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_025 like if you needed to like if you needed something ten inches you could use your hand cause it is about ten inches or if you needed to find something in centimeters you could use your pinkie
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_022 cause you keep on doing it over and over and over again so you get better better each time
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_016 i do not know
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_005 they are all the metric they all units of the metric system
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_001 i am good marnie thank you for asking
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_026 i wait i think grocery store i mean at a store like you might need to estimate how like if you if you want to get a table cloth you need to estimate how long your table is so it will fit
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_004 the floor up to doorknob
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_024 so you i am not exactly sure
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_023 estimating is about making real smart guess and it is good for if you are at this place and you want and you want to get a bigger computer screen you like can say i estimate this is bigger than my other computer screen so it is very helpful
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_002 started math unit on the metric system and now zero in the and and before that we did a unit on i forget what we did that before that
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_019 to make sure they got the right answer
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_003 that is kind of hard to do that i am not exactly sure which things zero i have one it is on an easel in the classroom
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_020 it depends like if you want me if you read a book over and over again that is cause you like the book if you measure something over and over again it is cause you wanted to get the right length
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_006 every ru places of the united states uses the metric system to measure stuff
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_013 it is ten inches
myst_996718_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_017 i do not know
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_015 the ones that you do not test that is probably the things you think are not going to work and then the things that you do test are probably going to be the things that you will test
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_028 well we thought through what would be the best way to get the plane across and er farther and that is wh that is basically what we thought
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_029 well you have to you should only change one variable at a time or else you never know which one is right
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_018 the ones that you changed in in the x the variables that you changed in it the experiment you would not change like any of the plane you could you just add things on and then if like if they would if those do not work you would take
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_012 number of winds
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_017 so the the ones without the paper clips goes the farthest and the ones with the most paper cl clips goes the least
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_030 you would get more accurate answers and things
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_027 we were trying to figure out if the distance goes up when we add passengers or if it goes down when we add passengers
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_013 so the top is the variable number of i mean the first one is the number of winds the second is how many passengers there are and then the third one is the distance
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_011 well the winds the more the like the fifty-one would go the farthest distance and then the ten would go the less distance the least
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_020 i want to figure out if if you had more on how would it affect how if flies
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_026 the number of passengers
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_025 how far the distance i mean just the distance
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_019 that if you did change them it would affect how if flies
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_006 well if you try you think of what would be the easiest way to get your plane to work and so the ha the easiest way to if you thought of that easiest way it would not take all that all a lot of time to do it
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_024 we are trying the experimental variable i mean experiment is what we are trying to figure out we are trying to figure out how far it will go
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_021 well when we got to like eighteen paper clips it was weighing the string down which we could not really start it from the top without it just we could not really get a real a real length of how far it would go cause it could it would go by itself cause the string was sloped
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_022 cause if you changed all of the all the var more than one variable you never know which one is right
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_003 you want to
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_023 so it the is the number of winds is all thirty-five then it goes the number of passengers twelve thousand, three hundred and forty-five then it get as you increase the passengers the the the distance goes down
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_004 i mean you want to make sure everything is right like try you try to get everything that you can to have a good experiment
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_009 the independent variable is the paper clips
myst_996433_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_005 independiv independent variable is that you just tra change one thing at a time and if you if you change more than one thing at a time it you would not be controlling a good variable
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_010 the shortest of length the string is swinging the most and then the longer string is swinging the least
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_004 well if well the shortest the shorter strings would swing longer and the longer string would swing the least
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_002 well we have been doing pen pendulums and we started doing p graphs about them today
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_005 you change like you only change one thing at a time like you could ch change you could add a penny or take away what your bob whatever your bob is and it that is yeah what a like a variable is
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_008 you could do it step by step showing how you measured the string like how like in what measurement you used it you could show what bob you used or how you attached it
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_006 if you it would not be a controlled variable
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_011 could you you use a graph and yeah
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_003 there were string with a paperclip and a penny on the end and we are trying to see how many swings it does in fifteen seconds and how much weight i mean how long this how the and it changes the swings with the length of string
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_013 if you did not have the x axis you really would not have a graph cause you just have the number of swings and it would be not really a full graph
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_007 well if you just put one together did not really pay attention to like the length or how heavy it was you probably would not get the best you would not get the best that you were trying to get
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_012 in the bottom it shows the length of the string and on the side it shows the number of swings
myst_996433_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_009 this one is about how long the string is and how many swings it did
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_004 it is a pendulum it the penny is what keeps it spinning
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_010 one will swing for a little bit then s slow down two will go longer and then so and so
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_006 it keeps on spinning at the same level
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_005 what keeps it swinging
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_002 we have we have been learning about pendul pendulums and how they work
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_013 the other the shorter one would probably swing maybe six for fifteen the longer one would probably swing ten for fifteen in fifteen seconds
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_016 that it would probably swing the least amount
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_015 so the shorter one swung longer than the thirty-eight centimeter
myst_996433_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_012 it will swing eight swings for in fifteen seconds
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_004 the bigger it is the more pennies it can hold
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_007 well if you do not measure you never know which one is right and like well you if you do not measure you you it really is not a project cause you it is good to know it is you nee kind of need to know everything the most important things and that is one of them to do a project
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_016 well controlling a variable means you change one thing at a time well controlling a good variable i mean a good vari yeah a good variable is changing one thing at a time instead of changing the like all of it at once because you never know which one was right if you just change everything
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_009 m making if you want to hold a lot you would make the boat wide and higher and you could you would even out the weight
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_002 we have been learning about boats and how much they can hold
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_001 not a lot
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_008 to you want to use accurate measurements because i you it could it might hold more pennies in if you just cut it like whatever shape or size or
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_014 the one with twelve is just it looks like they just dropped them in there and did not think about the weight and then the one with twenty looks like they e evened it out nicely
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_015 well they dropped it from a pretty high height instead of just setting it down and then when they did that it pushed it down then it in a cup in like it the next two it pushed it down and all the way enough to get water in it and then it sunk
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_006 the higher it is the more you can fit in cause it takes longer for the boat to sink that and get water to for water to go into the cup
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_011 the location of the penny you could even you could either stack em up on top in the middle which might work or you could just switch off going to each side which c would even it out probably more and get it have it more stable
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_005 it it is telling you the number of the cup and how much it can hold
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_012 well on the one with fifteen you can see that the pennies are all on one side and it it looks it is leaning to the right and then if you do a couple more it will lean enough to the right that it gets water in it and on the one with the twenty it is evened out perfectly
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_010 we you would not drop them from a high height you would try to just set them in cause if just set them in you could probably get more in ins if well it if you dropped them in it it would push weigh it would weigh the cup down and the then there are more chances of water getting into it
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_013 it was it weighed down to the right side and then it just got water in it and fell to the gro bottom of the tank
myst_996433_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_003 well we are te we are te trying to see if the bigger it is the more it can hold and the if the smaller it is and it how much it can hold
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_010 well the rubber it the propeller is has been spun up and and it spun the rubber band up and that then if you let go it will spin the opposite direction and move forward
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_013 well a p an important part of that is if it was not if we did not you did not have the small straw going through the jumbo straw you could not really put the line line in anywhere so yeah
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_002 we have been making planes and f flying them on fishing wire
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_012 well we to get it to work you have to kind of do everything right cause if like the rubber band is on the craft sticks it will not spin cause it will get stopped and if it is off it it will work
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_005 well we would we shaved them down a little and then we would staple them to the straws and then that would be the bottom of it that held the propeller
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_006 well we had a propeller in the back with a rubber band on it and on the other side of the popsicle sticks there was another plastic piece that we would attach the rubber band to then that would then we could spin the the propeller around and then it would move
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_011 well if you did not have the line the plane would not fly cause the line is something that hold that holds it up and the the propeller is just something that makes it move on the line cause if you did not have the line it would not fly like it does on the line
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_007 if you did not have the rubber bands it would not move because the you you could spin the propeller but it would not s keep going you it you could maybe get a full circle in
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_003 well we we used straws popsicle sticks and then a fishing line we put it through the top straw and then it had a propeller on the front so we twisted that and it was it would move on the fishing line
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_004 well there was one bigger than another so we we put two holes in the bigger one and then we saint we cut the smaller one in half and put the bigger in those two holes that we cut hole punched
myst_996433_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_009 well on this one you can see the propeller in the front and the rubber band going across and how it is attached to the back thing with the two popsicle sticks here pinching the jumbo straw with the small straw going through the jumbo straw with a fishing with the fishing line
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_011 if you drop them from a high height it would probably either go down fast it would probably go down faster or sink faster cause i if you like if you have three pennies in already and then you drop it really high it will push down so hard that it gets water in it and sinks
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_014 if it was if it was the water was like not even an inch high it would just hit the bot the cup would hit the the boat would hit
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_002 we started today learning about life about boats and how much weight they can hold
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_015 the boat would hit the bottom and like just come right back up without getting water in it
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_016 well the one with twenty is just stacked up straight which is could it could be a pretty good idea cause it is like evened out pretty well and the one with twelve is just like they are just put in not thinking about the weight evening it out
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_018 you could onl it is a controlling a good variable is when you only switch one thing at a time
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_010 maybe making the boat higher or longer to fit more people in
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_009 well i think the higher the if it was three centimeters it would hold more pennies in cause it is higher and it takes longer for the water to get up and if it is smaller it will get water in it faster
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_017 they were dropping them from a pretty high height and also they it they were moving around and pushing the boat down p it was pushing the boat down pretty hard and if you have fifteen pennies you would have to even it out pretty well to not let it sink
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_005 well we first put the boat in with no no pennies in it
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_012 the l location of the penny lower it will fit more and the higher it is it will probably you fit less pennies in
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_001 not a lot
myst_996433_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_003 well if you were like on a boat and it crashes these lifeboats can go down and people can get on them and then it will take they have motors usually on the back and they will take you to a l in instead of sinking you you can go to the closest land
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_005 well the string is going across and then no the the same parts working the same ways like nothing is falling off of it nothing is stopping or anything
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_011 the if you did not have the base the pa the popsicle stick could not go anywhere could not be held anywhere so it would not be able to flip anything
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_004 it is g it is going over and over again and it is doing the same thing
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_022 i think that the shorter one will shoot farther cause it goes up faster because it it does not have as long to go up and then the longer one it will go shorter because it is longer and it does not go up as fast
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_020 they do it by if cause you they like the the flipper base would connect with the angle brace and then the flip stick would connect with the flipper base and then the cork would connect with the flip stick
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_013 on on this there is c just a plane cork like and then the other one is the rubber cork
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_015 well the stick is in pretty far here and the it looks to like it is going pretty far and if may be if it was out farther it would go shorter yeah
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_008 the the paperclip is the most important part cause if you did not have that you c could not flip anything with it
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_018 it is like probably the biggest part in the flipper system cause if you did not have the flip stick it would not it would not the flip system would not be able to flip anything
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_019 you could describe the flip stick about
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_006 they are important because if you did not have some of them the it you would not be it would not fly the right way as if you did have all the parts together
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_017 it has the lines on it which is probably in centimeters so you could that is another variable you could change is trying every s sin like one centimeter at a time
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_002 today we started making catapults
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_021 there is one blank flipper i mean flip stick with no centimeter marks with but with the two sticks the parallel sticks and then there is one with marked centimeters five of them and then the two sticks with the ruler beside it showing the five centimeters
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_010 the wooden one is the flipper base and then these are the two corks here and then the flip stick and the angle brace
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_023 it well this is the shorter stick and it seems to be going up like arching high more like arching more than going farther but with the long one it might not arch as much but it it will go shorter cause it does not have as much s power
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_012 the flip stick is it is the what is going to go in the base and that is what is going to flip the cork
myst_996433_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_003 systems are like the way it will work like it will tell you about what like it will you will start making it and then you will you will put it you will like try launching it and then you will just keep on doing it
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_015 when trying to put them through the screen they were not put in because they are too big
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_016 it is being kept away from the water because the screen separated them it is important because they are now not a mixture
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_017 the screen is separating them from the water
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_013 they were out of their mixture and not kept together anymore
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_003 they all are mixtures of different things
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_009 it is called a mixture when one or more i mean two or more things are compared to
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_018 the result is important because it can it was put into a mixture and if you put it into the big blue thing is will be separated
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_004 they have different kinds of things in them
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_030 the part of the mixture that was dissolved was the salt because it was put together and then the salt and was by the water and dissolved
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_027 more rules that they have in creating the solution is when you put the salt into the water it creates a mixture dissolved
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_021 they were put together into a mixture and then separate
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_008 it has everything in it that makes it a mixture
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_006 the salad the salad has different things in it like lettuce tomatoes and olives and the nut mix has tomatoes m and ms and raisins i mean nuts m and ms and raisins
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_001 good how are you
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_023 it became a mixture and then was separated
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_019 the mixtures were changed because it was separated into its own thing the sand and water was separated from zero i mean the sand and and
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_011 it is not compared and when you put them all together it is called
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_022 when you when you stir
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_028 i do not know
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_020 screen is separating the sand and water
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_029 what is important about it is before it is mixed it is just a cup of water and just a cup of salt when you put it together it creates a mixture and then dissolves
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_026 i do not know
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_002 we have been learning about
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_033 no i do not think so because after you put it into the water it creates a mixture and dissolves
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_025 when it dissolves it becomes part of the other mixture and creates one big solid
myst_005016_2014-01-27_10-40-23_MX_1.1_012 they were out of their
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_037 this has to do because it is dissolving becoming a the water makes the salts marney i love you you are my best friend
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_010 i think that the salt is the solid and the water is the liquid in this picture it is important because the liquid and the salt when the solid which is the salt when it goes into the liquid the water it becomes a dissolving solution
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_013 we call the thing that does the dissolving the solvent
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_007 what happened to the salt is that when the sand and water were put together to make a mixture it was dissolved
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_031 that means it is a solution it is a solution because the water and the object went through and i mean did not go through
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_042 marney can we go over this whole test again
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_006 i think that when the sand and water go together that it the sand does not dissolve like it or does not dissolve as fast as it is supposed to and when salt and water go together it dissolves as much as it needs to and makes a clear liquid unlike the sand
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_021 marney this does not make sense
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_023 what is the term marney
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_038 well actually it could filter out to be a solution if it was possible kind of but what is creating this is that because the water is turning into it it creates little tiny spectacles of salt crystals
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_039 what is left is the tiny salt crystals that is important because that means the water has the salt crystals has has absorbed the water creating tiny salt crystals
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_014 the mixed solution on the right is fifty grams because it has many types of things that is called mixture
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_015 i notice that the plain water is fifty grams but you add the fifteen grams of salt and it becomes sixty-five grams of salt water
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_040 marney can you zoom in on the picture please
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_043 you too marney have a good day you are my best friend
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_005 the water and sand it being put together and makes brown liquid water and the water and sand i mean water and salt are being put together making a clear liquid
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_027 i notice that the water went through and it became a mixture solution
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_022 well looking at the weight of everything being put together i notice that the water plain water is just fifty grams and the salt adds fifteen grams and it combines and makes sixty-five grams of salt
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_016 that when you make more things go into one hundred and eleventh of all it becomes a mixture and two it adds more weight because of how heavy the other object is
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_030 what is this object marney
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_025 what is up with this repeat
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_028 i think this means that it is a mixture i was wrong it is a mixture it is not a solution because the water does not go water goes through but it creates a mixture because the flour does not go through and so it creates a mixture not a solution
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_032 marney i do not know
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_019 the mass is creating a larger amount because of more mixtures being brought into
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_036 marney what is dissipating mean
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_020 i notice that when you had just plain salt in the cup with nothing it became just the water was heavier so you had to add blocks and then you added water to the salt and then you added more blocks and then the salt water and the blocks were equal amount of sixty-five grams
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_009 i think that it is called a
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_018 the mass of the stuff going in
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_011 i think the solute is the salt in this picture and its position is the solid in this picture
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_008 i think that the water in this solution is playing the liquid because the grapetastic is a solid
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_026 i think this is a solution because i think is you add the water and the through the cup then it will become a it becomes a solution because some flour will go through so it is a mixture solution
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_002 we have been learning about salt and water being mixtures and dissolve
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_017 marney i can not see the
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_034 what happened in this picture is that you put salt and you added water and then you let it sit over time after you stirred it it became into salt ice crystals as it sat over night because the water had dried out and the over time the it turned into cracks and if you look closely on the ice the salt crystals you will see is on
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_004 that when you mix sand and water together it just makes brown muddy water and when you mix salt and water together it makes a clear solid and liquid
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_012 i do the solvent in this picture is the salt because it is a solid solvent and the liquid is the
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_035 well marney the water is disappearing from each dish because it is dissolving the salt is shrinking into the water
myst_005016_2014-01-30_10-35-48_MX_1.2_041 what is happening is that over time as you let the salt water sit out it the salt absorbs the water and it creates salt crystals
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_001 good how are you
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_015 i do not know
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_009 the chemical reaction occurred because the happened and it went down and changed
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_003 it makes it a salt crystal wait has it started out zero
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_005 neither what is happening here is that as it as you add the stuff it makes it precipitate and then as the solvent goes the water fizzes and it makes a product but the second one does not make a product cause it does not have a chemical reaction
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_008 well as you shake and moisten the bag the person is hand is making it precipitate more
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_013 i think with the bag closed it raised three more grams because the bag is closed it has more gas and the precipitation is not being able to leak out and with the bag open the gas goes out and the precipitation leaks out too so it weighs three less grams
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_014 i notice that the in both examples is that with the bag open it weighs three less grams because the gas and precipitation is going out and with the bag closed it weighs three more grams because with the bag is closed and the gas precipitation is not being able to leak out
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_006 and then you make the precipitation go
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_011 i do not know marney
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_012 i do not know
myst_005016_2014-02-27_13-31-14_MX_4.2_004 precipitation is happening and it makes it moistened and like saturate the solvent and to
myst_005016_2014-02-24_11-04-15_MX_4.1_010 it is a product
myst_005016_2014-02-24_11-04-15_MX_4.1_007 well they produce together and since it is fizzling the product is all evaporating together until the stops
myst_005016_2014-02-24_11-04-15_MX_4.1_001 hello how are you today
myst_005016_2014-02-24_11-04-15_MX_4.1_003 i think what is going on here is that the reactant vinegar and the reactant baking soda are going to go together and they are going to make a product evaporation
myst_005016_2014-02-24_11-04-15_MX_4.1_004 i think what happened was the reactant of the product like everything mixed together as a mixture and it all stained through so it made a lot of bubbling and fizzling
myst_005016_2014-02-24_11-04-15_MX_4.1_005 i think what happened was that we so solutions came together and made a product and so they evaporated together
myst_005016_2014-02-24_11-04-15_MX_4.1_015 yes i think there was a chemical reaction with one and three but not two because baking soda is more likely to make something evaporate and one and three both have that and two does not have that
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_002 lately in science we have been learning about mixtures and solutions but most recently we have been trying to solve to make a solution and so we are taking mixtures out and making them into solutions one product again
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_003 the in the purple and the blue one cup is concentrated and one is diluted
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_012 because of the twenty grams and the ten grams of solute being compared will be the twenty grams be heavier because it is ten more grams of
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_017 solution one i mean solution one is the most concentrated and solution three is the least concentrated
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_004 what i can tell you about concentration is that concentration is where the color is more focused than non focused and blurry
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_008 i notice when these two cups of salt water solution that they both have seventy-five milliliters of water but they one cup has twenty grams of solute and the other one has ten grams of solute
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_018 solution three solution one is the most concentrated and solution three is the least concentrated
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_006 from a picture of the scale i can tell you that the rock weighs ninety grams and the feather weighs weighs two grams so the rock is eighty-eight grams larger and
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_009 i can see that between these two cups of salt water solution that one has ten grams of solute and the other has twenty grams of solute
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_001 good how are you
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_019 solution the first solution
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_010 the one of twenty grams solute will be heavier than the one with ten grams solute cause it has ten more grams
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_016 solution three is the most concentrated and the least concentrated is solution one
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_015 solution one is the most concentrated and solution three is the most diluted
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_011 my prediction as correct
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_013 i think what has to do with the mass and solute is that the mass is greater and than the solute
myst_005016_2014-02-06_09-55-07_MX_2.2_007 i can tell that before you put the feather or rock in the with the cups the scale is balanced when you put a feather in it adds two grams a little heavier on the left side but when you put the rock the ninety gram rock in the right side it makes the right side nine hundred and eighty-eight grams more heavier
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_017 by adding different amounts of water
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_010 i also think that it was the left one more diluted because it is not focused and is blurry and the right one i mean the left one is more concentrated because it has more and it is more focused
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_006 you could use the color like simple if the one on the left is more concentrated because it is darker in is more focused the one on the right is not concentrated it s diluted because it is not as dark and focused
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_018 by adding more water to a different cup
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_002 we have been learning about diluted concentrate liquids that have and mixtures and solutions
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_003 well take a solution and you have to make a mixture and then somehow separate the mixture
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_011 what is true of the darker color solutions is they re more concentrated and the other ones that are not as dark are more diluted because they are not as focused on you so they
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_020 because you could add different amounts of water in the different cups
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_012 that they are more diluted
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_008 well let s tell you about the liquid it is more concentrated and not as concentrated as if the color is darker and it is more focused on you and not as focused on you
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_013 because they don t have as much powder as the concentrated one
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_016 because you put might so you put the same amount of water in it that doesn t matter it because you put three spoonful s in the diluted one and six spoon fulls in the concentrated one that s half of it and it doesn t it ll taste a little different
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_007 we used our eyes nose well we used our eyes and we really focused on it and so how it was and so yeah
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_004 marnie i do not know
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_009 well according to the magnifying glass on them i think that the left one since it s not it also show that is not as concentrated because only as two grams of sugar and a lot of water and the right one has five grams of water and lots of water is more concentrated and more darker
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_005 the one the left is more concentrated in the one on the right is more diluted
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_015 it would taste not as strong and a little bit more diluted and
myst_005016_2014-02-05_09-30-09_MX_2.1_014 i think that one with the higher concentration would be more stronger and have a little more taste than the diluted one because the diluted one doesn t have only has spoon for it to mix with fifty millimeters water but the other one is fifty milliliters water so five have been fully
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_022 i do not know
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_006 i think this means our solution b has salt in it and solution a does not
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_013 they would not blend
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_012 i think what is happening that since they re blending it s causing a far more concentration and dilute
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_011 they did not blend they did not blend and they do not want
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_002 in science we have been learning about mixtures and solutions and how they can be took in a part and if you re going like when mix salt water and from wait the concentrated and diluted
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_023 because the blue is the heaviest and green is a light
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_019 it is a difference of ten grams of salt
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_005 it flow down to the bottom
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_021 that the bluest four grams is the heaviest so it was concentrated and then red is the second concentrated and then green is the most diluted
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_018 marnie i did not see them
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_020 i noticed that blue is the most concentrated and then red is a little more diluted than green is
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_003 the penny and cork have to do before you doing science is because the the cork is on top because it weight it weighs lighter the penny floats to the because of the salt because it is heavier
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_008 well it would depend on if it has salt or not
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_017 someone either added too much pressure or you do not have the right amount of each
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_001 good how are you
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_009 it would float to the bottom
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_015 it would not blend and they would look concerted from concentrated to diluted
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_010 well since the solution a and b have fifteen millimeters of water and there s six grams of salt so it should be a sixteen grams of salt solution b has sixteen gram grams of salt sixteen grams of salt so it can be would get more darker because it has ten more grams
myst_005016_2014-02-10_09-53-12_MX_2.4_007 the difference is that the solution b has salt in it and solution a does not since solution b has salt in it the salt pushes the weight all the way up because it has no weight to go in the bottom
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_021 the crystals go away
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_009 it s is more concentrated then diluted
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_024 all crystals would be the most density
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_007 with the water the citric acid must weigh more because it has than because it s but the sugar must weigh more than the citric acid because it has one hundred grams the epsom salt has only forty grams
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_006 you are getting the citric acid with the three scoops and so making it more concentrated and then the sugar is getting more concentrated and so then they re both being diluted and concentrated
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_010 well if you know about the solubility chart and the substance and the appearance because is not needed to saturate things in the water going together and it s not being sugar is the one hundred grams the citric acid is sixty-seven grams the epsom salt small like grains it s forty grams and the salt is seventeen grams
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_017 while the citric acid is feathery flat clear like crystal the epsom salt is spiky needle like clear like crystals and the salt is like square clear white crystals
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_011 what did you say marnie
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_012 yeah everything goes into the fifty milliliters of water and it s it dissolves and then if you put more in it doesn t dissolve all the way and so it can t go all the way and so yeah
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_016 the substance two is the most leading and
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_022 well the crystals were not make clear
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_003 the citric acid goes in that fifty epsom salt and the other fifteen and the sugar is always in the
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_004 it is more concentrated because the 4s scoops is more and the three scoops makes it more
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_023 well it go and clearly to the dish and don t come out
myst_005016_2014-02-13_10-25-39_MX_3.2_013 now substance in the a i think is critic acid because i think of the sugar because the sugar and the other one is that so zero it must me small like
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_015 marnie i can t see the picture
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_019 i noticed that the magnets separated the the paperclips and the sand and gravel because it s magnetism and it sticks together
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_018 i think we use different solutions and different mixtures it has it helps for different projects
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_024 i think we used filter so that the water to go through and the sand did not
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_022 what is a sieve
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_001 good how are you today
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_008 marnie i cannot see the picture
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_025 i noticed that the water and salt were separated and after time the sand had the salt has have the water had evaporated in the salt and it became salt crystal
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_012 learned about using a magnet it is important because the magnet uses magnetism to get the magnets up
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_029 my best friend bye marnie marnie can you keep talk to me
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_021 i noticed that the gravel separated from from the sand because it is a bigger object and it can t go through the holes
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_016 what is the sieve
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_020 i think we used a magnet because otherwise it won t be able to separate
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_003 one way we can separate a mixture is using a screen another is taking a funnel
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_006 i did not understand
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_007 marnie i did not understand this
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_023 i noticed that the sand and water separated quickly because the sand was separately from the water because the water went through
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_004 a mixture is something of twelve or more objects should mix together making a combination
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_028 i think we talked about everything mixture and solutions that were on and separating them through the mixture
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_002 recently our teacher has set up this experiment for us and she said a different kind of something in the experiment it was magnetism
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_005 the object and water is being separated from with from the screen
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_026 i do not know marnie
myst_005016_2014-02-03_09-44-56_MX_1.3_009 more the two items are initial being separated from the screen the screen is separating the two items the water and that could
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_028 the light bulb if you turned it around that is what makes it stop because the minuses are touching each other so that is how they can not work and if the and the minus go together that is how they can work
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_026 because there is the two batteries touching each other i do not know
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_013 by making the two light bulbs work
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_008 it is making it light up by a light bulb i mean the battery
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_015 by connecting to them
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_021 that will make the light bulbs brighter
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_009 the d cell is making the energy is going through the wires to make the light bulb work
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_020 say will not work because there is only one battery and there is like fifteen of them light bulbs
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_005 the battery is making the light bulb light up
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_014 is to flow through the battery through the light bulb and through the wires
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_003 circuit what okay circuit is something that can light up
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_006 battery to run
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_027 they both make the light bulbs work to create energy
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_007 so they can all light up so it can make all the light bulbs light up
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_011 the d cells are going through the battery and the light bulbs to work
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_018 if we add more the batteries still get brighter and brighter
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_023 the light bulbs will get brighter and brighter
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_012 those are the d cells that is the energy that can make the light bulb work
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_022 we made the light bulbs more brighter so they can have more energy in them and less power in them
myst_007072_2014-03-18_10-58-10_EE_2.1_029 that they are not working
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_003 the needle is making the well what is going on here is the needle is making the wires still going from because the needle is metal
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_017 the rock can not make the rock is an insulator too because it can not make the motor run that does not it is not metal
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_015 that electriciy is energy
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_011 what i notice is the popsicle stick is not making the energy flow because it is not metal
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_009 the plastic the metal nail the base ring the paper clip the clip the nail and some other thing is making the motor run because it is metal
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_013 that it is plastic
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_007 that if things are metal it can conduct electricity if it is not metal it can not flow from for electricity
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_016 because conducting is not flowing
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_018 it is not spinning still
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_010 a conductor makes the electricity flow
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_004 parts there is a needle a switcher three wires and a battery
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_001 i am good how are you
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_012 it is because of the popsicle stick
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_002 what we have been learning science it is energy
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_020 what i notice about the paper clip that is making the energy flow
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_021 objects are conductors the rock the sponge the rock the plastic straw and a stick
myst_007072_2014-02-24_13-09-21_EE_1.3_006 the nail is making the motor move
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_026 the one that is not aluminum because that has more force in it i do not think it is metal
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_036 talked about stuff that can stick to metal and stuff that can not stick to metal
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_015 it has no magnetism because it has no metal in it and the nail has metal in it so
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_027 so the rock the ring and the aluminum nail can not stick
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_019 because they all have iron in them
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_017 because the refrigerator has more magnetism and the nail has a lot of metal because it can stick and it is metal it is iron
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_025 that has little magnets in them
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_024 iron can stick to metal because it has little magnets in them
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_021 other nail does not have any iron or force for it so it can not stick
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_014 a nail paperclip a paper thingy and other any metal stuff
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_032 stick because it has it is metal
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_022 some metals for magnets can not stick so it can not work
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_034 because it has metal inside it
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_016 the nail has magnetism because it has metal in it and the block has no magnetism
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_008 the nail is sticking to the magnet because it is iron or metal or steel
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_010 yes because it is metal i already told you that
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_020 more metals sticks to magnets
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_009 because it is metal iron or steel
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_029 that gray block does not stick
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_013 the wood block is the wood block the magnet can not stick to the wood block because it has no metal in it
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_007 because they are metal
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_002 we have been learning about magnetism okay
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_004 at the office remember he magnets can stick because if it is at the the same side it can not stick if it is same side it can not if it is the same side it can not stick if it is a different both different sides can stick
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_006 the magnets are sticking to the refrigerator because it is magnetism
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_005 it has magnet force in them
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_012 i do not like you
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_031 that it will not work because it hasno metal in it or iron or steel
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-04-37_EE_3.1_033 it is working because it has metal in it so like little stuff in there
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-02-25_EE_2.3_003 not so much
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-02-25_EE_2.3_005 because the switch is not on
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-02-25_EE_2.3_001 i am well how are you
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-02-25_EE_2.3_004 it shows a light bulb
myst_007072_2014-04-04_11-02-25_EE_2.3_002 we have been learning about magnetism
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_029 that it produces energy
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_025 it is making it produce energy
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_013 he or she is pounding on is making sound energy the he or she is doing sound energy
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_030 it can make stuff move
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_012 we can it has a color that we can see
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_026 because the wind thingy gets is the wind is pushing it and a solar panel is making the wind thingy go the rocks and the oil just make for the rocks it makes fire and the oil makes a car move
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_027 i do not know
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_024 it is making the motor move
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_028 because the solar panel can make stuff move and the wind thingy can make stuff move too
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_002 we were we have been doing making two light bulbs to work at the same time
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_037 building circuits tethers zero no i do not know
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_007 it makes is because of the heat
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_015 it produces sound energy
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_010 it sounded like nothing
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_005 the fire is making the wax water because it is melting and to so yeah
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_011 i see the wax melting and the fire burning
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_019 by eating a healthy snack like an apple or bananas or grapes
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_031 the coal can make stuff move like a train and the oil can make stuff move like a train
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_001 i am doing great how are you
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_006 it gets it comes wax off wax it comes off it has heat for heat energy
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_036 energy source means like it does not have any energy left someone used it all up
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_023 it is making it move
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_017 girl is walking up a mountain
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_033 the coal is hard and the fuel is a liquid
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_004 i see a candle producing heat energy
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_016 you can hear the sound when the stick is banging on the drum
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_003 heat is important because it produces light
myst_007072_2014-03-07_11-24-44_EE_1.4_022 it is heating up to turn to fire
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_009 it does not work anymore the energy is trapped
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_024 that is not spinning
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_002 well we ve been doing in science is working to make a motor run with wires a battery a motor and two more wires
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_028 this picture showing is the battery making the motor run because the d cells from the wire
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_019 for the sun for the motor to work so it can work
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_012 can you repeat that please
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_026 tha is not moving anymore
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_023 it does not work because there is no sunlight for the energy to work for the motor
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_016 sunlight is making it is like a calculator making it work by the sun
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_014 it does not work the energy is not flowing anymore
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_006 it turns the battery okay the switch right on to the left when you put it on the wire and it makes it spin the way you put it out from the wire it does not spin and it makes it turn off
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_025 the sun makes the motor spin
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_013 for the switcher to turn to close
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_007 motor is moving it makes the energy coming back again
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_004 for the motor to run it is for the battery touching well the wires touching the motor and the battery to make the motor run
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_001 good how are you
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_005 the battery is making the motor work because it is flowing energy to the motor and coming back around and round
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_029 thank you a lot
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_017 what happens for the motor to run is to have sunlight so it can work
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_018 for the sunlight to shine on the thingy
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_008 because you need metal to touch it for energy to work for any other energy
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_003 the energy from the battery
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_020 it will work because it will not work so it will not work
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_022 it turns the motor on
myst_007072_2014-02-12_09-02-26_EE_1.2_027 the energy is not going to the motor anymore
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_020 i do not really know i forgot
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_011 electricity comes from a battery
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_018 the energy by the blue light bulbs and the both the wires
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_021 with two batteries it make it brighter
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_029 the second one
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_017 they are flowing by from the light bulb
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_012 the blue dots are the energy going around and around from the light bulbs
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_004 it has its own pathway
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_007 the bulbs are going around and around
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_006 the battery is making two bulbs work
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_016 they all have their own side
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_014 that they are going around and around
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_013 the in this picture is the battery making the light bulbs work
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_026 yes the other bulb is turning off and on and the other two are just staying on i am done now now you speak
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_024 the dimmer ones are not really bright right because i think they have much energy in them
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_015 the battery is making the light bulbs work
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_022 it looks like the bottom one is not so bright at all
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_005 the both light bulbs are lighting
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_009 it will get more brighter
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_010 i do not know
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_019 i notice the light bulbs are lighting up with the wire
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_027 the first one because it looks like the more brighter
myst_007072_2014-04-02_12-48-26_EE_2.2_008 the first light bulbs are more brighter because they have more wires and the second one is more darker because it is
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_010 okay we we measured how much it could hold with a weight with a weight last week
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_015 okay the volume of liquid and the capacity of a soda can
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_021 we could use a syringe to measure it
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_020 we could use a sy syringe and measure how much
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_008 we measured how cold it was a with a thermometer and the b was coldest
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_019 i could fill it up to the top and it would be three hundred and thirty-three milliliters
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_006 i do not know
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_022 i do not know
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_013 it could tell us how high the cup co the cup could hold water
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_012 we could use a ruler and measure how high it went up to
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_009 how cold and how hot it was
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_017 the volume is how much it can hold and the capacity no the capacity is how much it can hold the volume is how much it is holding now
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_007 we measured how we measured how much the temperature was and saw how cold it was
myst_999489_2009-14-12_00-00-00_MS_3.3_016 how much it can hold
myst_997478_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005 it when the the more wraps around the rod you make the more washers it can pick up
myst_997478_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004 well if you wrap the wires around the middle rod it creates a magnetic field and it can pick up washers and when you by the switch the magnet turns off
myst_997478_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_008 well if the switch is open it will not let the flow of electricity go all the way through
myst_997478_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007 well if you open the s if you open the switch it blocks the electricity and if it is closed it lets the electricity flow
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_007 well they are officially sticking together so they are trying to attract attract to each other but the poles keep them apart even though they are still touch trying to touch each other
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_017 it has been nice talking to you bye
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_011 well when the magnet is still touching to the nail and the paperclip is on the side the nail is acting like a temporary magnet if you take the magnet off then the paperclip will drop or the m the nail will still be a temporary magnet for a little bit longer
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 they are repelling and so if you move the pencil it will they will bounce because they are both on the opposite sides so and one side and if the if one magnet is on one side and the sa the other one is on the same side they will snap together but sometimes they if they are on different sides they will they will stay apart so that is what is happening with the two magnets on each end
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_010 well like one side is like like the same kind as the other side so when you get em by enough to each other they will attract and if they are on different sides they will if you get em by the other one will push the other one away
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_006 the magnets are creating mag magnetic field around the pole so the magnetism is traveling through the pole or maybe on the outsides to the magnet is left so they then they still stick to the pole and hang on to each other because they are the magnet magnetic fields are touching each other
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 because in our classroom we did this exact same thing and that happened
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 well like the one the magnets on the pole the magnet magnetic fields are touching each other through the table or around the table so they are sticking to each other u they are trying to touch each other but they can not because of the table so they still connect to each other but on if the surface is really thick sometimes it does not stick and one magnet will fall to the ground
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_004 it was like they did not want to be together they they did not have the same kind so it was it was not attracting each other so they would not stick so it was like they are both pushing with like invisible like arms or something
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_003 it is where when you put like a magnet to a nail it sticks and maybe you can put a paperclip on and it will stick too but then when you take it off it might drop or sometimes it still stays on for a little bit
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_013 since you rubbed the magnet against the nail it still has a magnetic field around it for just a little bit longer and once the field wears off the magnet the paperclip that was stuck to on it when the field was working it drops because the field we wore off
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014 the nail is sticking to the paperclip because maybe just before you put the paperclip on the magnet somehow maybe touched on the counter if you had it on a counter so it touched and then some of the f magnetic field got on to it and it is sticking to the magnet i mean to the paperclip
myst_997478_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_002 studying magnetism and playing with magnets
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_012 it gives the light bulbs more power to run to the light make light brighter and it is more powerful so
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_011 there is only there is two batteries not just one and so the two batteries give it more power so the light bulbs can run h better but when in our classroom when we used two batteries it my group could not make it work so
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_021 it flows through out of it flows away from the out of the negative end because it is just flowing out of the and then wants to turn into positive so that flows through
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_004 the bulbs are both lighting up but in our class th we could not get em to
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_018 when the battery is flipped around it changes direction but the min it is still flowing out from the negative so when i switch it it changes the flow so if i flip it it goes the opposite direction but still comes out of the negative
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_009 the ba the battery charge the source of electricity has to flow through the wire to the receiver so the light bulb turns on but then it also goes back around so it keeps going through and through
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_020 it always f comes out of and goes into and so it travels through and so yeah
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_015 it the bat the the second bulb does not it is not as bright because it the it travels through the first bulb uses up the energy but then it has to travel to another bulb so it does not it does not use uses more and so the second one gets less energy
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_022 it always flows away from the negative end because it wants to turn into positive not negative so it will always turns into goes away from the negative end
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_019 it flows away from the negative spot end because it is and it wants to get to positive i guess and so yeah
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_003 well one circuit is a series circuit and one is not bec there a c one is a series circuit because it has two light bulbs and it has to transfer f through two and one is us is not is is not a series circuit because it only f uses one light bulb and two wires
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_008 it it makes it it goes around so and so it comes around and then it keeps going in a circle and it powers the light bulb
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_005 both are fairly bright but the one with that is not a series circuit is really bright the one higher is bright an in the series circuit but the one lower is not as bright because it is the one that ah yeah they are just one is brighter and one is not
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_017 well the flow of the electricity flows from the negative spot and goes and comes through the positive after traveling through the batteries i mean the light bulbs and so it keeps flow going ful so it goes it goes out and then goes in and then goes out and back in circles like a circuit
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_016 the bulbs get less bright and so the battery uses up less energy and i guess it takes more power to travel through through two batteries so the bulbs are not as bright when there is two batteries and two bulbs
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_024 the battery always has to g flow back into the positive not negative
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_010 the number of batteries there is two so one is pushing through and then it is connecting to the light bulb to make the light bulb run and then it is going back through so it keeps going in a circle starting at the minus going out and then coming in from the and going in
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_025 it is time for me to go
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_023 it always has to flow into the positive not the negatives and it always comes out the negative so yeah
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_006 one of em has really bright because it is only goes through one light bulb but the other ones are not as bright because it has to go through two circuits so they are not as bright
myst_997478_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_3.1_002 we have been studying electricity and using circuits and then today we learned about series circuits
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_015 it has to be some sort of metal aluminum brass metal to generate power but like a straw it would not because it can not flow through with metal through me like metal because
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_016 they are the straw the craft thing the rock and the sponge and the other rock because the they can not flow through because it is not metal so it can not flow through as easily and it will not transfer because actually i do not know why
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_006 conductors are pieces of metal that can make the m motor also work if you connect it f the conductor from the on switch to also the metal just like you can put connect them at on switch to the metal so it m makes the motor run
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_020 it is so if the generator is working and the motor is working and someone maybe walks by and it is on a table they will not accidentally touch the wire and th you will get electrocuted or shocked and so it is just to keep people safer
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014 the circuit generates power because the the e electricity will pa will run through the metal like through the on switch and then it will make the motor run
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004 so the switch if it is connected to the metal and because the switch also connected to the battery it will generate power to turn on the the motor and then it will start spinning
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_019 well the insulators do not power anything and so the motor will not run and get powered by anything and so you will not have a working motor
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_026 only iron and copper i mean only copper can work with magnets be but nails can too and paper clips and s some thumb tacks and i do not think the washers can actually but the metal fence does too
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_009 i discovered that if there is any any type of metal can conduct electricity but if it is not metal it will not make it so like the rock it would not work unless it was a special kind of rock that is has some metal in it and so it only works with metal
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_007 the nail is connecting to some other metal so it makes the metal generate powers to make the motor run just like the on switch would
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_013 the light colored nail is aluminum the golden ring is brass and the paper clip is metal the darker nail is metal the fence thing is metal and the thumb tack is brass i think
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_005 i put the straw in the wrong place because i just thought it was a strip of metal
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_012 i actually just remembered that i aluminum does stick because it is metal just a different kind
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_018 insulators do not make the motor run because is they are solid when it comes to electricity er electricity flow and so it does not power the motor
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_025 it does not work with magnets
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_022 what do you mean
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_008 all metal is c a conductor is what i learned today so it powers the generators like the on switch would because it is metal
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_010 i do not know
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_017 they do not let metal f flow through them they are just kinda solid for for with electricity
myst_997478_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_003 well the battery is connected to the switch also to the motor and if you connect the switch and move it over to the metal parts on the switch it will it will turn on the motor and it will power the motor and to make it the red tape spin
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_011 they got stronger and stronger and stronger because there it s more washers than the magnet
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_009 the when i went up to nineteen again the magnets were attracting out first but then it is started repelling
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_013 when i added the washer it got separate the magnets separated from it
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_021 ah the force is really strong because the spacers are not letting the two batteries can not the two magnets coming together
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_010 it gets heavier and heavier
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_017 when i added just one washer the magnet was so heavy that it just brought the other magnet down
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_012 it gets stronger and stronger each time you add something
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_007 when i went up to nineteen it stopped it went down
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_019 well north and south can be but south and south and north and north cannot
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_004 the magnet is moving around in the paperclip is sticking
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_016 they re repelling from each other
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_003 the magnet is bringing the paperclip through
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_018 you do on adding and adding and adding
myst_007008_2014-04-24_09-41-32_EE_3.4_005 it is a magnetic field
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_015 when the white light hits the blue ball it turns into blue
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_013 they are pretty i do not know
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_012 it is a rainbow
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_004 it is white light
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_003 they all produce light
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_028 yes i get it okay
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_016 the one hitting the ball is still light the ones that reflect are blue
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_033 i do not know
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_022 the one that hits it is hitting a white spit the ones that reflect are hitting a yellow spot
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_008 get split up to many colors
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_006 when the white light shines into the thing a ma the colors get split because white light is made of all the colors of a rainbow so when ti goes into the cylinder it splits up the colors yeah
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_020 same thing just the it is just yellow this time
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_026 shades of light ah
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_029 i do not know it turns black
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_027 they change color
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_017 i do not know
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_005 the sun light bulb or candlestick
myst_012227_2015-01-26_09-21-07_EE_5.2_025 uhm when the light shines through the paper it changes the color of the object
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_010 there is small gravel and large gravel and the small gravel is falling through the screen but the large gravel is staying on top of the screen and the water is staying with the small gravel and flowing through the screen
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_017 the paper clips are magnetic so the magnet draws all the paper clips out
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_018 because different mixtures have different density and values so if you use a magnet it will draw all the magnetism out and if you use a screen then you can get all the large objects out
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_003 a mixture is when there is two materials that are mixed together but the materials keep their own shape and substance
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_023 every material other than the salt stays in the filter but the salt flows through
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_027 it is a solution
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_022 i noticed that the paper clips were not in the mixture and that yeah i noticed that
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_006 you have a mixture of water and gravel and you are using a screen to separate the water from the gravel by pouring the mixture into the screen
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_025 salt water you evaporate the water so the salt crystals can be seen again and they take up a different form
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_002 we have been talking about mixtures and solutions
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_028 we learned how to filter and screen and evaporate all different materials and the mixture out of the solution and also we learned that different materials can have to be filtered out a different way
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_021 i noticed that the gravel would stay on top of the screen and all the other ingredients would fall through the screen
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_007 it can be separated
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_024 to get all the ingredients out other than the salt
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_020 because the paper clips are magnetic
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_016 because the sieve separates the large gravel because the gravel can not fit through the smaller holes
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_001 who are you barney
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_012 the paper clips have magnetism in them so if you use a magnet to draw them out they will stick to the magnet and separate from the mixture
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_019 the paper clips
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_008 because it separates the two
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_005 there is paper clips in sand and you are using a magnet to draw out the paper clips because the paper clips are magnetic
myst_014020_2013-12-19_12-48-35_MX_1.3_013 magnets and screens
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_033 it is a mixture
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_039 you let the water dissolve
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_004 the salt is going to dissolve into the water
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_008 the salt dissolved and it is important because it became a solution
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_023 the two materials weights stay the same
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_006 the salt is dissolving into the water and the sand is becoming a mixture with the water
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_034 it means that this is a mixture
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_030 the salt water is poured into a filter but the water particles with the little salt particles in them go through the filter and back into the cup of water
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_027 they are pouring flour into the water and then filtering out all the flour so the flour and water become separated
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_020 it shows us that all the different materials keep their same mass when mixed together
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_040 you are letting the water evaporate so the salt crystals are still there even though it appears they dissolve
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_022 i see that the water the regular water equals fifty grams and the salt water i mean just the salt equals fifteen grams and the salt water when it is all mixed together it equals
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_019 mixtures and solutions the materials that are become mixtures and solutions keeps their same mass
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_016 all of the materials weight did not add or subtract they all just got added together
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_017 the two materials mixed together equal the weight of both materials added together
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_018 that it keeps let me start over marney okay so i do not want to talk to you okay let me start over again it tells me that the materials keeps their same mass
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_043 it is letting the water evaporate so the material is still there
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_029 a mixture is when the materials keeps their properties and a solution is when the materials have different properties than their normal self
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_026 you let the water dissolve
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_047 we learned that we can not separate solutions but we separate mixtures but the only way to separate a solution is to let the water evaporate
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_036 the salt water did not filter out
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_032 it is considered a solution
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_031 it means that the salt particles have dissolved into the water and all the particles are smaller than the holes in the filter so it flows through into the cup
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_024 the different materials keep their same mass when mixed together she is so stupid
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_044 you could let the water evaporate
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_007 the salt is a solvent so it dissolves and the sand is a the sand is a solid so it becomes a mixture with the water
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_014 the solvent is the material that the salt dissolves into
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_045 the salt is left and it is important because you put it there in the first place
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_046 you pour the water into a larger dish and wait for time to evaporate the water and the salt crystals are left at the bottom in a different form
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_035 you can filter it out in a mixture but not in a solution
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_002 we are learning that all mixtures and solutions can be separated
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_003 that salt and water makes a solution and sand and water makes a mixture
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_001 i am good how are you marney
myst_014020_2013-12-17_12-44-59_MX_1.2_011 the material that dissolves is called the solute and the material that it that the solute dissolves into is called the solvent
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_022 with more water
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_001 hi martie you look very pretty today not
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_023 adding or taking away water
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_014 that they have more concentrate
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_016 because it has less concentrate
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_007 like in the grape fantastic example the one on the left is more purple than the one on the right
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_019 one taste more watery and one taste more full of flavor
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_011 the one on the right has less concentration and the one on the right has more concentration
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_020 adding different ingredient
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_002 mixtures and solutions
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_004 the one on the left is more concentrated
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_008 the one on the left has more concentrate
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_013 they have more concentrate
myst_014020_2014-01-09_12-46-13_MX_2.1_003 you dissolve a solute into a solvent
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_001 i am good how are you
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_022 when one materials dissolves into the other material the material that dissolves does not really disappear it is still in the water it is just you can not see it when the water evaporates the material that dissolved is still there but it is in a different form
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_012 they are getting separated and it is important because they are not just one giant mass of solid
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_013 they are separating
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_007 the trail mix on the left has all the piles on the right in one pile and the trail mix on the right is three separate piles of the three different ingredients
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_020 the salt and water
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_019 the cloth in the filter is separating the sand from the water while the water is flowing through the cloth and into the cup below
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_011 the different ingredients are getting separated out of the main pile
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_008 we call it a mixture and it is important because it mixes together
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_014 we are filtering the marbles from the water and it is important because we are separating the two materials from each other
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_026 the salt will get dissolved and with this mixture it becomes a solution not just a mixture
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_018 they changed because they separated
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_005 there is salad trail mix marbles and paper clips and wood chips and they are different because the marble they are all different shapes
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_010 the different groups of trail mix separate and that is important because it filters out the different kinds of ingredients
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_017 the sand separates from the water in the filter and it is important because the two materials were combined and now they are two separate piles of material
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_004 they all have mass
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_024 the salt has particles that dissolve into the water and the particles that dissolve in the water float around in the cup and the particles are invisible so you can not see em they are microscopic and when the water evaporates the particles are still there but when the water is still there you can not see the particles
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_003 it relates by mixing water with solids
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_009 we would call these solutions
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_021 the salt dissolves into the water
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_016 the screen is filtering the marbles from the water
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_027 yes you could dissolve the water in the grapetastic juice and then the grapetastic flavoring will be lying at the bottom and you can pour that back into the grapetastic compartment
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_006 the marbles are round the trail mix is rugged the paper clips and wood chips are smooth and the salad is spiky
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_002 we are learning about solutions and mixtures and that salt and water mix the salt does not dissolve
myst_014020_2013-12-12_12-52-58_MX_1.1_015 they are getting separated
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_020 because one solution plus another solution equals a bigger solution
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_018 they poured solution a first and solution b second
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_016 first they would mix together and then the orange one would sink to the bottom and the blue one would rise to the top
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_003 the cork has more density than the penny and the penny has less density than the cork
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_008 they would sink
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_025 by marni i will miss you so much and i am excited for our next lesson
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_012 the less concentrated solution goes to the top because it is less less dense
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_022 the one at the bottom is the least dense
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_002 we are trying to find the mystery ingredient in mixtures and solutions by filter and screening and all the scientific stuff
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_011 they are more concentrated
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_014 one rises to the top and one sinks to the bottom
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_006 that solution saturated than solution b
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_013 they are creating a different solution with equal concentration
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_009 it would sink
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_015 one is more dense than the other so one floats on the top of the other
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_019 because the solution is is more
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_007 one has more density and one has less density
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_023 because the less dense solutions molecules move slower so they sink the bottom and the least concentrated solution molecules move fast so they rise to the top
myst_014020_2014-01-30_12-30-14_MX_2.4_010 if a liquid is more concentrated it is less dense
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_003 the drinks on the left are less concentrated and the drinks on the right are more concentrated
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_002 we put a rainbow in a straw and we saw how much salt can fifty milliliters of water hold
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_013 the ones on the left are less concentrated as it goes to the right they get more concentrated
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_009 one of the cups is more concentrated than the other cup
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_012 my prediction was right because the one with twenty grams of solute was more concentrated
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_008 to weigh the two objects
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_005 yes i am familiar with a balance
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_006 the rock is less dense than the feather cause the feather have has holes in it
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_019 bye marni i will miss you so much
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_011 the one with twenty grams of solute will be heavier than the one with ten grams of solute because it is heavier
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_016 solution one is the most concentrated and solution two is the least concentrated
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_018 b is the most concentrated and c is the less concentrated
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_010 one has twenty grams of solute and one has ten grams of solute
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_015 the most concentrated is one and the least concentrated is two
myst_014020_2014-01-28_12-49-08_MX_2.2_004 for example in the grape drink mix you can tell it
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_006 the ingredients made a new product
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_013 they all stay the same
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_005 the chemicals in the materials creating the solution made salt
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_012 the two mixed together and math happened
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_009 they changed to form gas and salt
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_003 the solution bubbled and rose and this is because an acid mixed with water or
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_001 good how are you
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_017 they are different because one bag is open and one bag is closed
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_007 the mixture created gas
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_010 there is different molecules
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_016 they are different because one let the gas go and one kept the gas so it weighs more
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_004 the solution created salt when it dissolved
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_002 we have been studying chemical reactions
myst_014020_2014-02-10_13-21-18_MX_4.2_014 it tells me that everything on earth can not be remade or destroyed
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_015 that if you still can not see it you still add weight to it do not you
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_037 it is the sand salt is dissolving
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_006 the salt disappears and it evaporated while the sand it just sank to the bottom and made the water dirty
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_024 the flour mixed with the water can be filtered so the water and the flour can be separated again
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_031 now it is a solution
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_030 it is a mixture
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_022 i do not know can you tell me
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_011 the salt dissolves unlike the other solutions like sand and water it like sinks to the bottom and makes the water all dirty i hate your face marni
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_045 is my friend ephraim very ignorant or is he not a he is sitting right next
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_044 that evaporation can be used to separate salt and water
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_005 can you repeat my sentence you kicked me in the marbles
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_007 the salt dissolved
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_001 show me your full body please
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_036 you can use a filter
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_043 that over time the water evaporates and now the salt is back in squares not crystal
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_014 the salt added weight to the water so now it is sixty-five grams rather than fifty grams
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_016 some of them dissolved like the salt and some of them do not dissolve like the sand
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_040 i do not know
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_019 that fifty grams is equal to one cup of water
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_042 i do not know
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_020 the salt was fifteen grams and the water was fifty grams so it equals sixty-five grams which they put sixty-five grams in the thing so they were equal
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_039 the water is gone and the salt is still there even though we can not see it in the mixture
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_002 why would you kick me in the marbles marni
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_021 i do not know can you tell me the answer
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_023 i do not know maybe you could use a filter
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_008 i do not know
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_017 they all got mixed together so now it is a whole mixture
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_010 the salt dissolves but like the grape stuff it like the it
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_003 the salt disappeared and the sand made the and the sand made the a water very very dirty
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_027 i think it is still a solution
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_028 this means that it is still in a mixture so the salt is still in the water
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_018 is getting larger because you are adding three different thing
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_041 you can filter out the salt from the water
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_013 they are all mixed together and they equal fifty grams
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_032 yes yes you can
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_033 the citric acid could not be filtered out
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_038 after the days it is the water dissolved and now they have these salt square
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-39-45_MX_1.2_026 so it is a solution
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_020 they got filtered did not they
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_015 say that again please
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_032 i do not know marni tell me why
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_014 they are all different shapes and sizes and colors
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_011 the salt dissolves and the sand sinks to the bottom
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_004 we have been doing mixtures and solutions
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_018 why are you a floating head on a pedestal
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_031 no because it mixed in with the water so you would have so you can not
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_024 maybe you just need i just need to ask a question
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_001 good how are you
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_027 it was filtered by that blue filtering machine
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_017 the water and the marbles are separate now
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_028 the water will get dissolved
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_009 they are mixed unlike the other piles
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_006 you are mixing the salad the paper clips this wood and this bean
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_013 they used to be mixed altogether but now they are not
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_019 the water is now separated from the sand so they are two separate things
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_010 it is a mixture
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_016 you separated the marbles from the water
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_012 the raisins the m ms and the nuts were all mixed together but now they are not
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_023 it is dissolving so you can not really see the salt
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_022 the salt and water dissolves the dirt and water does not dissolve and the paper clips and wood chips just do not are is just a mixture
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_021 you used a special type of tool to filter the sand from the water
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_033 can you show me your full body
myst_014026_2013-12-13_12-26-40_MX_1.1_007 the salad has three different things in them
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-26-54_MX_1.3_003 using a filter
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-26-54_MX_1.3_002 we have been talking about science in science marney
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-26-54_MX_1.3_001 i feel very tired
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_018 it is crossing them off on the crystallization chart
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_007 i do not know
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_002 my obnoxious friends jaden and effraim keep talking so i can not tell you i am sorry marni
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_013 i do not know
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_019 the epsom salt is like
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_011 i do not know what this is marni but it says a solubility chart
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_005 the water is so saturated none of no more epsom salt or citric acid can go in
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_004 you were mixing the citric acid and epsom salt together
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_012 it is all saturated but now there is still more salt left over so you have to filter it
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_006 the citric acid is solvent i know i know i know i know i know you shut up my obnoxious friend jaden is kinda being annoying
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_003 you put sugar citric acid and epsom salt into the fifty milliliters of water
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_008 the sugar is weights weighs more the epsom salt and the citric acid
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_023 i think it is citric acid
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_015 i think it is substance three
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_009 i got the moves the like jagger i got a boobs like jagger
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-39-21_MX_3.2_021 i think epsom salt is on the dish
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_018 this is the one that should be correct
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_028 are you fat or are you not
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_009 i would like to use this one because you it is a very efficient way to
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_021 you are using a filter to separate the pebbles from the water
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_024 salt water dissolved and now it is just salt pieces
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_002 mixtures and solutions
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_008 you are using a filter to separate the pebbles and water
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_012 the important property is that the zero my gosh
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_004 okay let us get started
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_011 you separating the sand
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_005 no no i can not
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_016 can you repeat that marney
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_013 a magnet to get all the paper clips out so from the sand and stuff
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_025 the salt water is evaporating so the salt is back
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_023 you use the coffee filter to separate the water from the sand
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_027 about how evaporation can be used to separate solution
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_026 you put the salt water in that thing and now it the salt that water dissolved so
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_006 you are using the magnet to take to separate the things the
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_017 i am talking to a woman that may or may not be fat
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_019 this is the right one to use because it is magnetism
myst_014026_2013-12-20_13-17-16_MX_1.3_015 you are separating the gravel from the sand and water
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_037 it reacted but it like fizzed up a little bit because all of it was coming out at the same time really fast
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_021 the baking soda and the calcium chloride created a precipitation so that means that it is it it was really fizzy for a long time
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_043 it is glowing and that is important
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_045 when you put when you put grape fantastic into the water it mixes so so it turns purple a really light
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_014 water with the baking soda is like fizzing
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_008 i do not remember marni
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_032 i do not know
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_033 it got all watery on the outside too
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_003 when you put vinegar and baking soda together they are they make a chemical reaction which makes it all bubbly
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_030 i do not know
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_034 when you put ice into the water and over time it sweats and it has water outside the cup not inside
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_026 when you put sodium oxide and fifty milliliters of water with hydraulic acid it does not do anything
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_013 they are just missing a water
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_019 no they look completely different
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_046 there is a chemical reaction cause it turned purple good bye marni
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_015 the vinegar has blue and yellow atoms the baking and the baking soda has has white atoms so they mix it together and that makes white yellow and blue atoms
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_018 the baking sodas are all the same and the vinegar has two different things in it
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_027 what are the purple atoms
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_038 there is no reaction
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_029 two of them are purple they all used to be blue
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_041 bike had rust on it at the end of the year so that means it does have a chemical reaction
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_049 you such marni i hate you so much
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_022 baking soda and calcium chloride
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_036 the carbonated water is so carbonated that it can not stop moving with the carbonation
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_047 no it is a mixture or a solution
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_023 they made a chemical reaction
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_010 you mixed all them together
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_005 i do not know
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_017 they are all different atoms
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_007 they are citric acid baking soda calcium chloride
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_002 mixtures and solution
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_039 it went from rainy to snowy to dirty and the calendar fell off
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_044 once you snap the stick the stuff inside it makes a chemical reaction so it can glow
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_042 it had a chemical reaction inside when you cracked it or bent it something inside of it had a chemical reaction which makes it glow
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_020 means that they mix together to make a solution
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_028 the water with the sodium hydroxide did not do anything but with the sodium hydroxide and the hydraulic acid made some of the atoms purple
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_040 there is no chemical reaction
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_009 the contract or something
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_024 a mixture of baking soda and calcium and chloride
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-28-42_MX_4.1_031 you can dissolve it you put it out on the tray and it dissolves so you can find the atom
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_020 it would taste very watery
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_017 one has fifty millimeters of later and five spoon full and one has fifty millimeters of water and one spoonful
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_002 about mixtures and solutions
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_009 the one on the left is darker than the one on the right
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_016 they have less powder in the water so they do not have a zero my gosh you suck zero i am still holding the space bar down marni can you play a song for me
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_019 the one with six spoonfuls is more concentrated the the than the one with three spoonful
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_007 the one on the left is darker than the one on the right
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_014 you play a song for me please
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_018 it would taste a lot more flavor has a lot more flavor than the one spoonful
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_008 the one on the right has more purple things in it than the one on the zero my gosh i kind of i am sorry marni i can you repeat that please cause i did not get that effraim made me laugh and it was he is kind of obnoxious do not you think marni
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_013 the darker colored solutions you can barely see through them the lighter color solutions you can see through them very easily
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_011 the darker one has the most solution in it
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_025 it is the same but the one hundred and fifty milliliters of water it with less water is like adding more powder to the water
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_010 i do not know marni can you just tell me all the answer and i will like get them like implanted in my head so i do not have to go to school anymore and marni how do i change your face
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-30-38_MX_2.1_005 grape fantastic that is what it is called
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_008 calcium chloride and the baking soda had a reaction and it made it fizz up
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_015 the one with the bag closed it weighs more because of the gas has come out but the one with the bag open lets the gas out so it is lets so it is not as full
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_004 when you mix hydraulic acid and hydraulic powder and you put it in a tube thing and it is it is square and white clear crystals so it is probably salt
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_016 the one with the bag open is fifty-eight grams and the one with the bag closed is sixty-one
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_005 a reaction did not occur nothing fizzy happened
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_007 it fizzed u
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_012 it is sixty grams together
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_013 a reactant plus a reactant equals the product so twenty-five thirty-five equals sixty
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_009 i do not know what i see
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_017 because the one with the bag open let the gases out
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_010 dude and the solid is a product and it is yellow
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_003 something with water makes it a chemical reaction so you can not you put two things together and it makes a chemical reaction with water so makes a chemical reaction
myst_014026_2014-02-07_12-47-41_MX_4.2_001 tired really really tired
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_004 i do not know
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_014 the water is saturated it can not hold any more water or salt
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_007 you mix something with water that makes a solution
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_009 you are dissolving it
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_001 i feel like i am getting a very thingy
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_010 the water can not hold any more salt so it is settling on the bottom
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_002 learning about nuclear missiles
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_011 the erosion salt or epsom salt is dissolving into the water but it can not hold anymore
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_017 the salt solution is sixty-seven grams which so it means the salt is seventeen grams in there
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_008 you mix the salt with the fifty milliliters of water
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_016 the salt solution is heavier than the fifty milliliters of water
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_006 it probably means that something like that powder on the left is mixed in without water
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_012 epsom salt is at the bottom
myst_014026_2014-01-31_12-28-25_MX_3.1_013 the solid epsom salt is at the bottom so the water can not hold anymore
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_021 i hate you marni so much you are kinda creepy but you help me with science so thanks
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_002 i am doing good marni how are you doing
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_017 they are all not even
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_010 i think the one on the right is going to be heavier because it has twenty grams of solute and the one on the left has ten grams of solute
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_016 you can use a scale
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_019 one is the most three is the least
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_005 you can not because it always dissolves in the water
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_015 the salt water looks the same the grape mix are all different colors
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_004 the grape mix is purple and the salt water solution is clear the salt is transparent
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_012 my prediction was correct marni the twenty grams of solute is heavier than the ten grams of solute
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_006 i think so
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_007 the feathers two grams and the rock is ninety grams the rock is going to go down because it weighs more
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_011 the one on the right has twenty grams of solute so i think that one is going to be heavier and the one with ten grams on the left is going to be less because it has less solute in it
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_009 feather weighs less than the rock
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_018 one is the most concentrated and two is the least concentrated
myst_014026_2014-01-10_12-46-06_MX_2.2_003 we have not been doing anything interesting in science
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_028 the solar panel has to receive energy from the sunlight and make it spin
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_022 the switch has just touch the wire
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_019 the motor is on and makes the flag spin
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_025 the electricity has to close to wire to the battery and into the motor
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_032 when i click on the certain of flags that spinning again
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_010 the battery is giving energy to the
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_027 so and that is traveling to the solar panel into the motor and making the flag spin
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_018 the circuit is open
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_026 when they get solar energy the power so
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_013 it has to switch making the motor stop
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_034 the solar panel is not receiving any energy and its stop the motor for spin
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_012 the battery gives the motor energy and makes the motor
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_023 the motor stops and move
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_004 or the flag is spinning and there is important because
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_035 it is showing energy transparent from the wire to this motor
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_031 the flag was stop spinning
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_029 the solar panel is receiving sunlight
myst_008043_2014-04-07_10-55-34_EE_1.2_011 it has to
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_018 to make light
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_013 it bounces off the
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_010 the light bounces off the object
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_026 we have been talking about reflections and how the light reflects out of mirrors
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_019 a reflection makes the the light travel through the mirrors and then it hits the star and the lights
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_022 the the reflection of the water is going through the water and it looks like there is two pencils
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_007 it bounces off and it goes to the mirrors
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_004 the eye reflects the light and it
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_002 we have been learning about light and how it travels
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_016 the ugly boy is seeing his reflection
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_023 the water reflects the pencil and it looks like there is two of them
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_024 in a glass cup with water is reflecting the pencil and it looks like there is two and the glass without water with looks like it has just one
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_020 the light gets reflected off the mirror and the mirror makes the light
myst_008043_2014-05-06_08-44-11_EE_5.1_003 the light bulb is turning on and the boy is
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_003 we ve been learning about series and parallel circuit
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_017 i noticed that there was two path way
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_024 the wires have to do energy has to travel longer than it was to
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_002 we ve been learning how to build parallel and series circuit
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_019 the series circuit on the left is getting
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_026 a parallel circuit because it that have to flow that
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_016 energy is coming out of the negative side and back into the positive side
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_007 all of the energy from the negative side of the d cell is going to the base of the light bulb and all of that energy is going back into the positive side
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_010 the light bulb but gets brighter
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-11-07_EE_2.2_023 because the energy of the light bulb has to stop like go and its making the light bulb get dimmer
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_007 that they conduct sour source of electricity to the to the battery
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_018 that end of the battery is flowing to the circuit wire of the light
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_022 the d cell battery flipped over
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_015 the neg the negative side of the battery is flowing to the circuit wire of the light bulb and the positive side is flowing to the base of the light bulb
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_028 i think the bulb wouldn t light if you touch the both of the wires to the base
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_017 the electricity is flowing out of the negative side
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_003 two green wires one d cell battery and one light bulb
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_010 light bulbs have different parts that make the light bulb light
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_012 i think it means to for a light bulb to be a receiver that it means that it receives electricity to light up the
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_020 the blue dots represent the electricity going through the light bulb and back into the battery
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_016 electricity flows by going through the battery into the light
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_001 i am doing fine how are you
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_026 the electricity is coming around the negative side into the light bulb that back into the positive
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_008 i think electricity travels a
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_013 that the wires are touching the casing wire of the light bulb
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_014 i see i see electricity trans
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_004 battery is a resource of energy that stores electricity
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_029 that when every time though the wire touches just casing wire the bulb lights i mean both of the wires touch into base it doesn t
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_027 the wire has touching the case thing wires so that it can light up into the flow
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_019 the wire is connected to the battery and it goes to the light bulb going towards the battery the d cell battery
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_002 we ve been learning on how to light light bulbs with wires and batteries
myst_008043_2014-04-04_08-34-41_EE_1.1_006 they are turning open circuit into a closed circuit
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_010 the circuit is closed and the electric current is flowing through the rivet and
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_002 we have been learning about electromagnet and how they work
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_018 the rivet becomes magnetized and mix up the water
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_007 it is a called a rivet
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_014 electricity flows through the wire and goes into the rivet
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_008 the wires is wrapped around the rivet
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_006 the rivet is connected to the d cell battery and the switches all making it a closed circuit so it is an electromagnet
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_001 i am doing well
myst_008043_2014-04-30_12-21-46_EE_4.1_004 you have to wrap it around the
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_015 the magnet is interacting with the nail and all the magnetism to bring through the nails stick to the paper clips
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_003 magnetic field is something that invisible and we cannot see
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_017 like the magnetism doesn t run through the nail and
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_013 the magnet is interacting with the nail and then all in the paper clips stick to the nail
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_024 because the magnetic force is been moved from the nail and the paper clip was
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_005 the magnet is attracting the paper clip through the paper
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_001 i am doing fine thank you
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_018 probably a few seconds
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_020 the nail interacts with the magnet and all the paper clips just stick to the
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_025 i think it is sure
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_026 it s showing me how the magnetism runs to the nail
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_010 the magnet will only goes to the piece of paper and all to the
myst_008043_2014-04-25_08-41-56_EE_3.3_002 we have been learning about magnetic fields and how they work
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_012 the other one turns off because the energy is flowing anymore
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_031 because it s a series circuit and when the other bulb let burned out the other bulb
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_022 this is a parallel circuit
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_016 because in the first light bulb burns out no more energy you can flow through the other light bulb and they both though
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_004 the bulb is not light because it is a open circuit
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_021 the electricity stops flowing
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_018 if the first light bulb is burning out and not letting anymore electricity flowing to the second light bulb
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_006 i think the light bulb light when took that the switch touches the wire because the switch is a conductor and it lets the energy pass thought it
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_019 the first light bulb burns out and no more electricity can flow through the other
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_030 one light bulb burns outs the other one turns off
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_023 the other bulbs states like they because nothing else is connected to others
myst_008043_2014-04-17_09-22-29_EE_2.3_026 the other bulb states it lay
myst_008043_2014-04-23_08-33-13_EE_3.2_006 because each magnet has the south and the north pole and when the south pole and another south pole constructing is i can t tell you
myst_008043_2014-04-23_08-33-13_EE_3.2_002 we ve been learning on how magnet interact with each other
myst_008043_2014-04-23_08-33-13_EE_3.2_003 the two brick magnets are sticking to
myst_008043_2014-04-23_08-33-13_EE_3.2_008 most of the magnets have south side that are presented to
myst_008043_2014-04-23_08-33-13_EE_3.2_009 the opposite poles
myst_008043_2014-04-23_08-33-13_EE_3.2_005 the magnets are repelling each other
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_005 i am weak and sick thank you for asking marni
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_023 the white light is getting absorbed to the white part of the ball and the the rest of the light is reflecting off of it
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_035 the filter turns it
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_029 the white light reflects off the blue and that makes the ball blue and the white part stays white
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_002 we have been learning about seeing colors and how they
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_017 through the prism and the prism separates the colors if it is real
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_043 when you shine the light on the brick it turns black
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_008 we have been learning about colors
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_037 the ball turns green
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_031 balls are boring to play with the ball is making it yellow because the white is pissing on it
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_009 the light is all yellow and it is making energy out of it
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_007 i am cold and weak thank you for asking marni
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_022 i think there are seven colors
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_006 we have been learning about seeing colors and how
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_001 i am cold and weak today thank you for asking marni
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_016 the prism is separating the white light into it is original colors
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_025 because the ball is bouncing
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_004 the light is shining to a direction
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_015 the prism is separating the white light into it is different color
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_030 the white light is reflecting off the yellow ball and is making the ball
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_040 only the green light will make the lemon
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_026 the white light gets turned into blue light and the white part of the ball gets absorbed
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_044 you would shine a red light on it
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_012 the white light can come from the sun no
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_039 the ball turned green because the yellow light makes the blue filter into blue light and the yellow ball
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_027 the white light is getting absorbed by the white part of the ball and the rest of the blue part of the ball is getting
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_011 it gives off white light
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_032 ball makes yellow and then ball makes it white because of white spot and yellow
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_041 the light is not reflecting off of it and the light is turning
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_013 i can see three sources of white light the light bulb
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_014 the light is shining into the prism and the prism is going to separating the the light the white light into it is
myst_008043_2014-05-12_13-51-21_EE_5.2_018 i see all seven colors of the rainbow
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_023 do you mean string of christmas lights
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_006 there is two paths
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_013 the other one goes out
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_014 it burns out
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_005 well it is like if one goes out if one bulb goes out the other one does not go out but on another circuit if one bulb goes out the whole thing goes out
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_016 electricity is re resembled by blue traveling dots
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_025 i got that
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_018 i did not say anything
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_007 if on a parallel circuit it is each bulb has a separate thing
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_012 probably a parallel
myst_997485_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_011 the electricity is traveling through and it is going through its separate pathway
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008 there was so many washers that it the they overpower the magnet and the magnet could not have more power
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006 i think it was nineteen magnets that was enough to take it had enough force to take away the power of the magnets
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004 there is enough washers in the one side that it overpowers the force of the magnet
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_010 the magnetic field
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_014 the magnetic field does
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_007 there is a lot of there is there is a lot of like more weight on one side and it overpowers the magnets and it is nothing and y and the magnets can not hold up any longer
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005 the washers ha er there is enough washers that it overpowers the magnet
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_002 working on magnets and water
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_015 blocks the magnetic field
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_018 you already asked me that question
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009 m there is the there is the amount of a gi a bigger amount of washers and and that is really strong and it overpowers the magnet
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_012 there is something in the way of the magnets and that and you can only have two magnets in there i mean two washers in there before the magnet breaks down
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_003 we put some metal metal on circles into em and and and see how much the magnet would force would the magnet c have
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_016 there is still a bit of magnetic field there but i do not think it is as strong as it was when it only had like a couple spacers
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011 they they still are trying to attract to each other but they just can not do it
myst_997485_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_017 it is called magnetic field and it and opposites opposites attract and the same det detracts
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024 the electricity has to travel in a full circuit
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015 the electricity is traveling in a circuit through the wire and wrapping around the i forget what it is called the steel beam and picking up the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_008 the electromagnet picks up the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_017 well electricity is powering it and it is just tol electricity that it is just like a magnet that can pick it up all the washers and iron and steel
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_026 i like cheese
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_019 well you have to think about the wire and then you have to make sure that the switch is already closed and that the wire wraps around a lot so it can pick up the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013 the battery is making electricity and it is going through and picking up all the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016 it is the it it is like the magnet which picks up the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_022 it has to be a full circuit and the battery has to be fully charged and if it is not charged it can not be do anything and the switch has to be all the way shut
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004 the electricity has to travel through to and it attracts things if it is a magnet
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010 it picks up the wa the electromagnet picks up the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014 the switch has to be closed all the way so the electricity can make a full circuit and pick up the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_023 probably because it gets enough electricity for just a couple small amount of time and then it just collapses
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_018 what is important is that it the more the wire wraps around the ribet rivet the more power it has to pick up the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012 the switch when when you turn it on it just activates the electricity and picks up all the washers
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_021 well basically it is until the battery lun runs out or the switch is turned off
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009 it is basically turning on the electricity
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005 it is an electromagnet and it is picking up all the washers cause it is really strong
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003 there is washers there is a d cell battery there is a wire a switch a holder and this steel rod
myst_997485_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_027 i i have seen paper clips be temporar magnets yeah
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_016 i think that iron and steel are rock so it might be containing in that rock
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_006 it is a magnet that attracts it is opposite and does not attract it is same
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_011 it does not do any m it does not stick to any materials that are not steel or iron
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_017 you asked me that but it it sticks to iron and steel mostly
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_008 it attracts things well
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_018 magnets usually stick to iron or steel and
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_010 it is attracting things that are steel or iron
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_013 i see some iron some steel some rocks some wood plastic and a sponge
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_005 we have been studying water and magnetism and things like that
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_021 the aluminum nail does not have the material in it that sticks to the magnet and the steel nail does
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_020 an aluminum nail does not attract because it is not really like the material that is supposed to go with the magnet
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_007 they attract the things are u that are not the same as them and they do not attract the things that are the same as them
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_022 m i think that the magnets that stick together are in opposite sides and the ones that do not stick together are
myst_997485_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_019 the saint the steel nail sticks to the magnet and the aluminum nail does not
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 electricity is traveling through and it goes past the motor and it tur and it causes the motor to spin
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_026 it is a it symbols a light bulb on a battery
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_016 it is a circle where the electricity travels through
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_009 it is the source of electricity
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003 they are wires and electricity travels through them
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_022 it cuts off the electricity so it can not run all the way through but when it is down and touching the other side it makes the electricity go in a full circuit
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002 studying batteries and electricity
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_025 it is a schematic and it shows the light bulb and the battery
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_004 there is a battery a motor a switch a wire a light and a base
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 it is the main base of the electricity
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_020 it receives the electricity
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019 when it is closed it it it is it can travel in a full circle to get to the light bulb when it is but when it is open it is cut off
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_007 s the battery and it has one positive side and one negative side and it is the source
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_023 it goes in a full circle when the switch is down when it is up it is cut off
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_021 they the electricity comes to them
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_031 well just two light bulbs are not as bright cause it has to travel through the light bulb twice but when it is one has more power because then it only has to go through once and it is not as tired
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015 they are the pathway of where the electricity travels through
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_024 it it makes the electricity travel in a circuit and spins the motor
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_014 it is the pathway over where the electricity travels through
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011 it is the source for electricity and it helps the electricity travel through the objects
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005 they have a lot to do with electricity
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_030 a switch a battery and a motor
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_006 it receives
myst_997485_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017 electricity travels through a cir circle
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_008 well if the wire the wire is touching the bottom of the battery and and the light bulb is touching the top the positive side of the ma of the magnet the battery and then you touch the wire against the metal s the small little metal part on the light bulb and it lights up
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_007 energy i guess
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_006 they are basically they are sort of a magnet and they are batteries
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_004 a battery a light bulb some wire and it looks like a holder i guess
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_003 it makes energy and the energy goes through and if we to put a light bulb on top of the magnet and stick the and stick like a wire attached to the bottom of the m the battery on to the light bulb it makes the light bulb light up
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_005 the magnet the wire the light bulb and holder
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_009 the wire the the part maybe where the electricity travels through
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002 we have been studying magnetism and a little bit of water not really
myst_997485_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_010 it says receiver and i think it it like gets the light it attracts the light when the wa when the electricity is connected to it
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_012 the parallel is in basically like better with and it is yeah
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011 the parallel when one light bulb goes out it does not bring down the whole thing just it just one light bulb goes out but when the series goes out all the light bulbs light out
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_007 the one on the right is brighter and the one on the left is not brighter probably because of the formation
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014 they are the electric they are the symbol for the electric electricity traveling through things
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_004 there is it is traveling through to separate sides and there is a bulb wires another bulb two more wires and a battery
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_016 there is one for each bulb
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003 it is it is two bulbs and it is traveling through both of the wires and it is using electricity but if there was only one bulb the light would be brighter
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018 there is a separate side for each bulb and it c and it they are the wire connects to each one and they gets their own electricity and then not having to share it makes the bulbs brighter
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_013 it is brighter because it does not have to share with another electric a bulb
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015 it is traveling through the wires and the bulbs
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_017 m it goes through the other side and it just keeps go traveling in a circuit for each side
myst_997485_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_006 two bulbs and the electricity is traveling through two circuits
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_026 light bulb and the battery
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017 the electricity is traveling in a circle
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_030 the two uneven lines represent the m battery i mean yeah the battery and the m represents the magnet the little line going off the big dot is the switch and the sort of like the other one is the light bulb
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_012 it is a receiver and then it probably receives the electricity
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_010 like a place where the electricity travels through like a tunnel
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 it travels through the wire and then it goes through and it goes through the motor and then the motor generates electricity and it charges the motor to move
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 the electricity comes to it
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_029 the motor the battery and the switch
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_022 the electricity is moving through the well it is traveling through the thing but it can not make a cu it is cut off but when it gets to the switch but when the switch is turned closer to the wire it makes the motor run cause of the electricity
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_023 the electricity makes a full circle through them
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_004 it is a battery and it has one positive side and one negative side
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_027 there is a motor
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_020 it turns the electricity on and off
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_016 electricity traveling through a circle
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019 when the the electr when the when it is not cl when it is open the wire is cut off and can not make a full circle to the light and make it bright light up
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_024 the electricity is traveling through the light bulb and n where it is cut off i think that is where the mate na magnetic field is sort of
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_032 you put the lever down
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015 the electricity goes to the battery and through the wire and through the motor and it makes the when there is electricity going through the motor that makes it turn and it just goes in a circle
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005 it is one positive side and one negative side and it generates magnetism
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008 electricity which is like sort of magnetism
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002 studying magnetism
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_033 it let us them electricity travel through properly
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_025 the light bulb and the magnet
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_014 the electricity goes through it and it makes the motor spin
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_021 it is traveling through but but at the end it is cut off because the the switch is away is away from the wire it is not by
myst_997485_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_009 electricity travels around
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_012 well you could use like pebbles or like drops of water or really anything that you know the measurement of
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_006 okay now i understand it
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_011 the metal disk was eight grams
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_013 well grams are the basic measurement that you use
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_002 zero yeah today we measured how much water a sponge can take up
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_003 grams and the weight of well not the weight but how mu how many grams like one small g small cube is one gram and five small cubes is fifteen gram and t ten grams is like twenty-five cubes or one hundred and one cubes and then and then it is basically just adding that way
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_010 i think that is the measurement
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_007 well becau well if you do not have a scale you sort of have to guess because because if you take eleven object you can not really determine like the exact weight so you have to guess and well you have to make an educated guess you just can not make a blind guess
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020 well you use rocks or well any thing that you really know has well that you really know the weight of you can use because you know you can add those things to get the the weight of the heavy object
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_015 the orange is heavier than all your weight put together so you could make you could have more weights or you could take some stuff and measure it and then go back to that measurement and put those things in and try to measure it that way
myst_999462_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_019 well a kilogram is a one thousand grams so you have to make ten thousand, one hundred gram bags to get a kilogram
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008 well some maybe some fingers are sensi are more sensitive or not sensitive and maybe that some water had been sitting out longer or put more ice or something or
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_024 well you know that because the higher the the higher the the higher the alcohol goes up inside the thermometer that is heat and the lower it goes it is cold
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_010 this is the different temperatures of water like a was twenty b was a little be below a little above zero and c was twenty and that tells you that a and c both had the equal amount of temperature
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 well thermometers can determine the exact temperature and you can make a pretty good gue and you can make a more educated guess or you can know
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 like well we can measure the temperature of water we can measure the temperature of the air around us we can measure the temperature of the soil and we can measure our body temperature
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016 well you place it sort of in the middle not to the side because if you put ice cubes in there it might be touching an ice cube and you would get different measurements or something so you just put it in the middle
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_006 well you sort of have to if you do not have like thermometers and stuff like that because it is you can not like make a thermometer out of air so you have to use your finger and your finger gets a pretty good guess of how of the temperature
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_009 yeah we had that in our class that and then we used thermo
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_002 well we have been try we have well we have been doing temperature and that kind of stuff and tomorrow we are having a the a measurement marathon it is where we have different type different experiments like ours is how far can you throw a paper different types of paper airplanes and stuff like that
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_021 well y so you do not really have to even put it in water you can just put your thumb on it and that determines your body temperature or you can or you can put it like just set set it down and that determines that determines the temperature of the air outside
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_017 you would you would wait for the alcohol inside to go finish going up or finish going down then you would read the temperature zero
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_018 well there is little numbers on the side and you read the temperature there
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_014 well degrees are the measurement of temperature like there is celsius and fahrenheit we were measuring celsius and there is degrees in celsius and fahrenheit like and there is different degrees in both of em like zero in celsius is thirty-two in fahrenheit so
myst_999462_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_003 it means that they have been sitting out longer or they have been or they have been like ice water or like ice put in them or something like that
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_026 when the switch is closed it lets the electricity flow through and make and let the r
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012 it has to be in a complete circle and it has to be a closed circuit for the magnet to work
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006 the wire is wrapped around the rivet
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_018 when the switch is closed electricity can flow through properly but if it is not then the electromagnet will not work
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_025 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005 you have to wrap the wire around or else it will not really work
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009 that the electricitier is completely flowing through
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024 some mag that some magnets need electricity to work cause they are only electromagnets
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015 it has to be closed for it to work
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014 the switch has to be closed for the rivet to pick up the washers
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_020 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003 electricity generates through the wire and makes like the thing turn on and gets like a magnet it the little washers will stick
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010 the wire has to be wrapped around the rivet to pick up the washers and if you have a switch it has to be closed for it to work
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_011 if you have a switch in it it has to be closed for the circuit to work
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_031 they have to be iron or steel because that is the only type that works as a normal magnet that will stick to like a normal magnet
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_023 a temporary magnet does not means it is not a magnet forever so some electromagnets need electricity to work as a magnet
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004 well since it is a electromagnet it has to have electricity for it to be able to pick magnetic things up
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_008 it is going and then the electricity is going to the switch and then up into the electromagnet to pick up the washers and then back into the battery
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013 it the washers will start sticking to the rivet
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_029 the little blue dots looks like electricity and they are s going out of the battery into the switch and then they are go and then they are circling around the rivets to make it a temporary magnet that is going by the battery
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016 the circuit has to be closed for it to work and if the switch is not closed then it will not work
myst_997673_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_002 we made electromagnets
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_027 the numbers keep going up
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_026 it picked up more washers
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_016 how much charge the battery has and how how cl if in the switch
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_018 you can wind it more
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_008 it has to be a complete closed circuit for the electromagnet to work
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_020 the more winds the more washers it can pick up
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_015 the stronger it is the more washers it can pick up because it has more stuff
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_011 the more winds you put on the rivet the stronger the magnet is
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_025 with ten wraps it got only three washers with twenty wraps it got five and then i guess it kept increasing until it got fifteen
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_028 the more electricity the stronger the magnet gets
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_023 it gets more electricity so it can get
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_012 if you have one hundred winds it is super strong so it can pick up fifteen washers but if you only have like five it could only pick up like two or three
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_002 they are magnets use electricity to work as magnets
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_031 i think it would be probably be ninety-one or ninety-two because ninety got fifteen and ten got like one or twenty-one like three and if you add five which is half of ten it would probably get one or two
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_014 the more electricity goes to the rivet the stronger it is
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_013 it has more electricity so it makes the mag the electromagnet stronger
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_019 you could wrap your
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_005 it is wrapped around the rivet
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_010 a closed circuit let us electricity flow but an open circuit does not
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_032 well ninety got fifteen and half of ten is five and ten only got three
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_024 probably in a bar graph like you would have ten winds three washers twenty winds five washers and it keeps going up
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_004 the battery is charging the me the little rivet to work as an electric mag electromagnet to pick up the washers
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_029 if it does not pick up very many then it d then it does not have many wraps but if it picks up a lot then it has a lot of wraps
myst_997673_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_017 more winds gives it more magnetic force so it can pick up more washers so if it has more winds it can pick up more washers
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_034 two batteries has more power than one so the light bulbs could be a little bit brighter
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_029 no matter which way the d cell is turned the little blue dots are always going to e go into a the positive side and out of the negative side
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_020 it goes around into the light bulb out of the light bulb into the other light bulb out of the other light bulb and then back into the battery and it just keeps circling
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_019 instead of it being like a wire or a battery there it is part of the light bulb that just goes up up around and then back down
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_036 i got to go
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_022 flowing out of the minus side and and then it is going around the circuit and then it is getting received through the plus side
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_030 since the negative side put the little blue dots out instead of going into the wire it is going into the positive side of a different battery and it is going through the second battery and out of the ne negative side there and then f doing a circuit
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_004 electricity trave a circuit is a way to let electricity travel
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_009 one has more things in it the other one just is a basic light bulb circuit
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_033 instead of going into a wire from the negative side of one battery it is going into the the potitive side which receives it and then going through that battery and then out of the negative side through the circuit and it just keeps going around
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_002 we made parallel circuits with the battery f and we had four wires and then we had little light bulb holders with a switch we put the light bulbs in both the little holders and tha my group tried it two different ways and then we looped them around from the battery to the light bulb and had to f find out some way to connect them to make both light bulbs light
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_028 the negative side you see the little blue dots coming out of
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_015 instead of go going like gets back into the battery a wire is connecting it to the other light bulb so it is flowing out into the other light bulb and then back in
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_017 it shows like where how they electricity flows
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_032 i am studying instead of going into a wire it is just going into the other battery and then out again
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_010 the wire on the right is more complex and the one on the left is just basic
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_016 it is going from the minus side up into t the light bulb down and then up into the other light bulb and then down and back into the battery and it just keeps circling
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_005 it is forming a circle
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_024 that you can reverse the we the direction of the l battery and then the circuit will flow the other way
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_023 the negative side puts the electricity out and the plu positive side brings it in
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_025 no matter which way you turn it the negative side is always going to put the electricity out and the plus side is always going to bring it in
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_021 i have already said enough about flow
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_013 we tried it one way that we ha we would and then we we we would have it like that except there would be two different wires coming out of the ends and then we would touch the ends of those wires together and we gist got a tiny little dot of light
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_018 into two different light bulbs
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_014 it is the way it flows if they are not touching very well only a little bit of energy could be getting to the light bulb but if they are touching like how they are supposed to be and like right on it the light bulb can get brighter cause it has better electricity flow
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_006 it has to go from the minus side into the light bulb out of the light bulb back into the plus side
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_027 the the little blue dots are still going into the positive side
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_035 i do not have any more time so bye
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_012 the more electricity there is the brighter the light bulb will get but we tried it a different way and we got a teeny tiny little fuse
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_003 a circuit is a way for electricity to travel and it makes some kind of circle form
myst_997673_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_011 they are both touching metal
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_008 they each have their own two wires that they can get electricity from but the one on the left only has well the one tw three wires that they have to share
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019 the circle with the loops are light bulbs and then the little the plain c lines are
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_025 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011 the flow is going up but you can change the battery around and then the flow will be going down
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_024 parallel lines are two lines that are not touching that are right next to each other so there is the battery is in the middle of it but there is tw the cir the circuits are parallel to each other
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_017 everywhere on the light bulb holder it is green so electricity flows all through it
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_006 the one on the left is sharing a wire so electricity is not is not as good as flowing through but the one on the right both of them have their own have their own flow that they that they can just take all of the electricity that they need from that wa that one and so they are a little bit brighter
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015 th the minus side is putting the electricity out then it is going up into the light bulb out of the light bulb and then back into the negative side
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_004 the negative side is putting out electricity to the light bulb holder on both sides and it is making the light bulbs light and then it is just going back into the battery
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_010 no matter which way the battery is turned it will electricity will always go out from the negative side and always go in f to the positive side
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014 the light bulb should have the same brightness and then there is two wires on each end of the battery so it it can like split the energy to go to both light bulbs so
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_020 the two little lines in the middle the eleven that is longer and the one that is shorter that is the battery and then the blittle loop representative represents the light bulb in in the and then it is in the circle
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_009 there is four pathways on the one on the right and there is only th three on the for the one on the left
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_021 the little loop kinda looks like a light bulb like the bulb part of it and w for the battery one side probably represents the negative side and the other side pro probably represents the positive side and wires are just usually little sticks so that is what it is supposed to be
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_012 the positive side receives e the electricity and then the negative side puts it out
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_023 it shows you that there is two light bulbs and it is a parallel circuit
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_016 there are four pathways two for each
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_005 it is a parallel circuit because both of the wires are both parallel to are kinda parallel to each other
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_013 the negative side puts it out
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_007 the metal parts on the light bulb holder the ones on the right electricity is flowing all through them but the ones on the left they are leaving out the little loop parts
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_022 everything in it represents something in a circuit
myst_997673_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_002 we were working with electricity and we talked a little abo ou a little bit animals that use electricity to find food and keep a predators away
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_021 everything has to be either like touching a battery or metal
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_026 the circle with the loop in it is a light bulb
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_033 it shows you a way to set up the circuit
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_025 the symbols all represent something so like the lines are just wires and then the little then there is two lines one shorter one longer and those that is the battery and then i think the circle with the little loop in it it might be a light bulb
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 if you touch the sw see there is the little holders for the wires then if you touch the switch to the bottom of it well at least that is what worked for our group that is what made the motor start spinning
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005 there has to be a wire or else the electricity can not travel through
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_016 it is touching m the metal
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_007 they let the electricity kind of flow through so they are kind of like the path a little pathway
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_006 they let the electricity run through it so it can like go to whatever you need it it to go to
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_023 the battery has the wires flowing up into it and out of it and then back into the battery making a complete circuit so whatever little thing is is will turn on
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_027 a battery one side is the plus side one line is the plus side the other side is the mi minus side
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002 we had a blue base a little mo a little motor with two white wires and a switch and one red wire and a d cell battery and we have to th there is a way to hook em up that so that so that motor would start running
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_031 the little line is a dot on the end is a switch
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015 it is touching metal and making the motor spin
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_004 it kind of puts the out the energy out into the wires so it is pretty much like the source of it
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011 it is receiving the electricity from the battery and it is running
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_010 it uses the electricity to start running
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008 it is kind of what the electricity goes to cause that is kind of what needs electricity so
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019 making a complete circle
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 it is flowing through and making the motor spin
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_029 there is a battery a motor and two wires
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_012 the mo the motor has the little stick that spins around and the flag is on it so when the motor turns on the little thing little stick spins around and li makes the little flag spin around
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_014 once the switch is touching metal it the motor starts spinning
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_020 it is going from one side of the battery up to the motor out of the motor and back into the battery
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_030 it is a motor the m is probably there because the motor starts with m
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003 we used a wires a switch a battery and a blue base thing
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_009 receiver means that you receive the electricity
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_028 the m in a circle is a motor and so the battery has two wires going to the motor so the motor it would probably be on right now
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_022 the battery has two wires flowing to the little circle with the thing in it
myst_997673_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_024 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_018 iron and steel which are both metal they are the only ones that stick to magnets
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_016 that conductors could be made out of iron or steel because electricity can throw through magnets and only iron and steel sticks to magnets
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_010 insulators do not let electricity flow through there do not by the circuit so nothing will turn on
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004 mostly the metal things were all conductors but like the thing the things like the popsicle stick and the sponge and the rock were insulators
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_007 what is ever in the circuit like the light bulb or a motor will turn on
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_005 conductors are things that let electricity through through them cause they conduct it kind of
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_019 they are both either iron or steel
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_013 insulators are not really made of metal straws wood rocks and like sponges none of them are made of metal
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_011 conductors let the circuit turn on but insulators do not
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_009 it can g like by a circuit and let electricity throw through
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_006 the conductors were pretty much all metal things and they let electricity flow through them
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_008 you by the circuit instead of touching the switch to metal you put another piece of metal on it and to by it
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_015 they are pretty much like the opposite of conductors they can not by the circuit because they are not metal usually
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_017 they are all metal
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014 they do not by the circuit so the motor does not turn on
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_002 we had two wires a motor and a blue thing and we w went around the classroom and the motor had two wires on it and we had one loose wire from the from the motor and one loose wire connected to one of the wi the other wire on the motor and we would tach em to metal things but not anything plugged in and then to see if the motor would start going
myst_997673_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_012 the motor stands still because insulators are not always made of metal
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_013 it is moving the mag it is moving the magnets farther apart
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005 the magnetic force is going the magnetic force is going through the cup so they are sticking together
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_016 magnetic force is decreasing ca cause it is harder for a magnetic force to go through thicker things and it and the spacers build up to make it thick so the magnetic force can not really go through it as easily
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009 it is harder for magnetic force to go throu through thicker things so the magnetic force was not strong at all so when you just put one washer and it tipped over
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_017 well we got the scale it came in two parts there was the actual scare up scale parts and then the part where that made it
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_012 the spacers just made the magnets get higher and higher and then get thicker and thicker so it is so it was harder for the magnetic force to go through it and and stick together
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_014 the magnetic force is going through the bottom of the cup so they can stick but it is decre but ma magnetic force is decreasing when the spacers are put between them
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004 the magnets were held were sticking together because with because there is a plastic cup in between in and we we had to drop so many magnets the washers are pretty heavy so we had to drop try to drop enough washers into it so so it would pretty much break the magnetic force to tip over to the right side
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_007 so it took nineteen washers for the ma for the washers to break the magnetic force between the two magnets so it would tip over
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_018 you should always either have like a magnet magnets together and washers
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_003 we would put washers in between the magnet and the cup with the and the cup with the magnet in it so they would so they would ha so it will be a little harder for the magnetic force to go through them so they could not ma cause so they could not hold as many washers
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008 the magnets have about like five spacers or has spacers between them and the sp the spacers build up so it is it is harder for the magnetic force to go through them so it does not have as much strength to hold as many washers
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_020 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_019 that magnets do not have their magnetism forever so group the group c was not v very strong so there was not even a washer between it so it only got five washers in before it fell but group a b and d were were all ninetee had all nineteen washers all of them had nineteen washers in em
myst_997673_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011 it makes it hard it makes it harder for the magnetic force to go through the washers so it does not have as much of a pull to the magnetic force so it is harder for the s so it is harder for the magnets to stick together when there is a lot of weight on the other side
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_019 that the magnetic field is pretty much swarming around the the nail and changing all the magnetic domains to act like a magnet and it is making the paper clip stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_020 the magnet was not on the nail and the nail had not been charged by the magnet so it did not have any so it was not acting like a magnet then so the paper clip would not stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_022 the magnet charges the nails to make it a to make it act like a magnet and turn it t basically turn the nail into a magnet so the paper clip can stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_009 the thick paper was too thick so the magnetic force could not generate through it so the paper clip would not stick but the thin piece of paper would stick because it was thin enough for the magnetic force to go through it
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_003 the magnetic force can kind of generate around like iron or steel and then give it the magnetic force to stick to other things
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 one of the magnets is generating magnetic force through the table so it is making it stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_007 i am not sure how it does it but magnets can just somehow generate magnetic force through objects to make another magnet stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014 since the nail is probably ha ha has to made out of iron or steel the ma the magnet changes all the magnetic domains inside of it to pretty much change the nail into a magnet so and paper clips stick to normal magnets so if the if the magnet is pretty much making the nail a magnet then it the paper clip will stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_017 it is either iron or steel
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 i was able to take two strong magnets and make em stick between a thick piece of paper once
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 with the thick one it was about like a couple inches apart but with the thin one it was like maybe like a millimeter or something a apart so it was so much easier for the mag the magnet to generate force through it to make the paper clip stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_023 ve to either cha you have to charge the nail by the magnet or ru pretty much rub the magnet all around the nail and put a magnet magnetic field around it to make it s to make the paper clip stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_004 they can go through objects to make em stick together
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_018 it is showing that the magnets can make the nail act like a magnet and make it stick to the paper clip
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_010 i do not know
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_027 i do not know why it can not stay a magnet for that long well because like companies that make magnets have a like a enormous magnet and that like charge all the other magnets around and you just charge it for like like a minute you only charge a nail for like a minute so it does not have the strong enough magnetic force to stay a magnet forever and pick up the paper clip
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_006 some magnets can be really strong so they can pretty much just put their magnetic force through tables or any other objects and make it stick
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_026 because the magnet charges the nail put a magnetic field around it so it can pick up the paper clip
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_025 the magnet had not been rubbed to charge the nail and put a magnetic field around it so it did not stick to the paper clip
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_011 the thickness really matters because if it is too thick then magnetic force will not go through it
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 that all the magnetic domains inside are all facing the same way and it is pretty much into m turned into it is pretty much turned into a magnet
myst_997673_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_015 since they are all separated the nail does not have any magnetic force to make the paper clip stick but if you you can hold you can kind of hold the magnet by the nail and then it will kind of change it make it into a magnet and sometimes if that wo if that works you do not even need the magnet to be on the nail f for it to stick to the paper clip
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_013 they stuck more to like one of the kinds of mesh that was wider and had more holes in it and it stuck in it it stuck it only stuck to a certain kind of nail
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_009 we have been testing magnets on different objects to see if they stick or not
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_015 because magnets only stick to iron or steel one of them was not made of iron or steel so it did not stick
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_002 hi marnie my name is nicoline how are you doing do you know what the day is
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_014 one nail is not iron or steel
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_018 the ones with that are like if you have n n they might stick together if you have s s they might stick together but you have if you have s n they probably will not
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_012 i do not know
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_017 when you like put em if you a put a magnet on same side they would snap together but if you put em on opposite sides they will like kind of bobble up and down kind of or or just not stick
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_019 the magnet in the middle is on opposite sides of both of them so it is not going to stick to any of them if it if they were on the same side they would all stick in the clump of five magnets
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_010 we tested them on like magnetic objects like mesh and nails we also tested them on like straws yarn and rubber bands and sponges and we also had cardboard and wood
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_011 they al they are all either steel because steel contains iron or iron
myst_997673_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_016 well if you pu it you put them same side they would snap together but if you put them on different sides we would slide em through a pencil and there would be an inch between em and then the one on the top would start bobbling
myst_020204_2015-03-17_13-00-51_SMP_1.3_017 the earth is spinning around the sun

myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_014 well well the lightbulb could be like for light and the battery could be for the computer so there both electricity so the wire goes there and the wire goes to the and then the wire goes to the and it will start work
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_008 well path well pathway means like the path it like goes around the pathway go
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_005 well if you did not have a battery you will okay you won t have electric it won t would not work for the battery
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_004 well the battery is about the electric so you connect the wire to the battery and connect the light bulb to the wire and it will light
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_023 if you flip back to the direction where it ends where is now the minus is going up now the blue dot is going to the and going up so and the blue things are going down to the plus
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_025 okay well this is a battery is the electric it is like these blue things they are going up to the they are going up to the lightbulb and going down to the plus
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_022 zero yeah well you switch this d cell now now these are going down and they are going to the lightbulb these blue things are going down to the and going and go to the going to the and going up and start over
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_013 well well okay well there is a wire there if you connects the wire there it ll go then to the lightbulb there and it go down to the battery to the and start over again
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_021 well this add this starts here at the and the blue goes up to the wire and it goes down and these blue things ends to the and it s starts all over again
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_007 well the wire can be handy for the or you just like connect the wire like the wire could be let for the plug and the some
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_012 a receiver mean a receiver means to use a d cell using a d cell source source so this is like a battery that helps computer work like that
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_006 well you put the battery to the with a battery
myst_007071_2014-02-06_08-01-59_EE_1.1_003 if you connect the wire to the battery battery it will light the bulb if you connect that one
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 we were trying to figure out which was hottest and which was coldest and which was in the middle
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012 well the red liquid is alcohol and when it heats up it expands and when it cools down it condenses
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011 we put the thermometer in the water and when it was down to the lowest or the highest point we would look at where at where the red liquid was and that would be the temperature of the water
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_020 you placed the bulb of the thermometer down in the water and if there is ice in the water you do not want it touching an ice cube cause that will make it look like the water is colder
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 the temperature went down fifteen degrees cause from start it was at twenty and at finish it ended at five degrees
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 it means that some of them some of the cups are going to be colder than others
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 when it is hot when it is hot when it wants to expand it means that the water is hotter
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_022 i think a would be warmer cause room temperature is temperature is around seventy and b would be colder because it has ice cubes its ice cubes which would start melting and cool off the water
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_025 i observed that it took a long time for the water for the water to start heating up to room temperature because when ice melted the ice is very cold so the it would get the water really cold and then it would take a while to heat up because it only it heats up little by little it does not all heat up at once
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 well you can measure measure the temperature of different well y you can measure the temperature of a lot of diff
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 well you can measure temperature in celsius or in fahrenheit most of the world uses celsius only the un only the the united states uses fahrenheit so it fahrenheit is a us standard measurement and the other and celsius is a metric standard measurement
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 the ice would start melting and it would make the water cooler for a little while but then in the when all the mice ice was melted the temperature would start to rise towards room temperature because it is it is exposed to air that is at room temperature once the ice is melted the water will start to heat up
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027 we only measured for ten minutes but my guess would be for it to warm back up to room temperature it would probably take twenty minutes but that is just a guess
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 he is measuring the temperature of the different cups
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026 i do not understand what do you mean
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 things you can water and they are th pretty much the easiest ones and the only ones that we have done
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_002 we got to make up our own projects and we had the and we had people rotating around at stations outside and they tested most of the sta
myst_999465_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 cup c would be twenty degree because it is at the twenty mark on the thermometer cup b would be zero degrees because it is at the zero mark on the thermometer and cup a would be twenty degrees because it is at the twenty mark on the thermometer
myst_999465_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_013 well you put something you are going to weigh on one side and then you use weights and put them on the other sides side and then you when it balances that is when you know how much how ever many weight gram weights you have in there are or how much it weighs
myst_999465_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_012 t we put in one side of the scale and then we weighed it to see how many grams by putting gram weights in the other side
myst_999465_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_016 well it takes like the disk the metal disk is balanced with the gram weights
myst_999465_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_017 basically all you do is put the apple or orange on the scale and then you put the gram weights in until it balances
myst_999465_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_008 we we weighed the sponge when it is dry and then then you check if it has some water and we put the sponge in the water and let it soak up the water and then as m well as much water as it can then we weigh it again and see what the difference is
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_006 i think it is like salt and stuff like that
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_027 that it mixes with the water and it stays in the water cause it is
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_039 it is evaporating from the the water is evaporating
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_017 that it is a solution
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_016 that they can weigh the same
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_007 well the salt dissolved but it is still there like other people other other people would say that it has gone but it it is just it is still there
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_046 that is that solutes and solutions can not be separated and that you can evaporate water to make salt crystals
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_029 it is considered a solution
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_002 we have been learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_008 i think it might be plain or it might be dissolved into the grape juice or the grape juice might dissolve into the water
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_040 mix a liquid with a with a solid then you can evaporate it to to separate it
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_025 think it might be a solution
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_043 that you they are mixing the salt and the water and that the then the water is evaporating and the salt is making salt crystals
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_031 that it is a solution
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_023 by figuring out the properties to separate each one
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_004 they are mixing two things together to make it a make a solution
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_042 the salt is left and it is making salt crystals and the water is evaporated
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_018 the mass is getting heavier and denser
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_013 that basically they are just adding ten grams twenty grams twenty grams equals fifty grams so the solution is fifty grams
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_005 the salt dissolves and the sand just sinks to the bottom and stays there
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_020 it weighs just as much as the individual components
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_041 you could evaporate it
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_015 that solute that solutions can weigh more than the solvent and the
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_011 i think the solvent is the salt cause it is going to dissolve into the water
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_045 how much time it takes for it to evaporate
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_030 i think it is a mixture
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_014 basically just adding them up
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_037 the water is the water is evaporating but the salt is creating crystals
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_021 that it that it adds up
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_019 i see that if you add the amount of weight to a different thing that it that it all adds up to the same amount of weight
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_028 that when you mix a liquid with a liquid it is really it is it is almost impossible to to it is impossible to separate
myst_014027_2013-12-16_13-43-46_MX_1.2_010 well i think the salt is going to dissolve into the water in this one
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_015 because you need to get the the the the the magnets out so that so that they use the
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_020 cause the rocks can not get through the sieve but the water and the mud can
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_025 i think it is a mixture and solution i think it is a mostly a solution but little bit of mixture
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_023 the the salt is the that the thing is the best for that one because it evaporates it is using evaporation to get rid of the water so you can get it apart so you just have the salt
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_003 mixtures are not are when you mix two substances or more together
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_018 get the pins out because the pins are attracted to magnet
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_008 rocks and the water get separated and the water goes down but the rocks stay on top
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_019 i noticed that the rocks stay on top and the water stays on the bottom or the the water goes through the sieve
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_002 just had science and we are talking about mixtures and solutions i heard you say solutions
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_022 the water can leak through the filter but the sand can not
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_005 the person is using a magnet to get the pins out
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_021 i see that the sand or whatever it is stays on top and the water goes through
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_024 means that the water will evaporate into a cloud and the salt will stay the salt will stay there and make little crystals
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_014 because the rocks and particle sizes so that the rocks
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_006 you are using a screen to sort the rocks from the water
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_026 learned a lot about different tools help with different solutions and mixtures bye
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_007 the water goes through the screen but the rocks stay on top of it so you are separating the the rocks from the water
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_016 cause different different different tools can help with different problems and mixtures and solutions
myst_014027_2014-01-13_13-44-03_MX_1.3_004 by using water evaporation and maybe magnetism
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_019 the sand and water are being separated into into groups with their own kind
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_006 there are marbles in water there are beans mixed with looks like jelly beans there are pins mixed with some sort of wood chips and water and salad
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_016 they are being separated and and the marbles are being filtered out of out of the water
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_029 probably not because because unless unless there is like some sort of like iron in it that you can magnetize out it is pretty much when you mix a liquid with a liquid it pretty much stays together forever
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_026 it is a type of mixture that will dissolve the salt will dissolve into the water
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_014 the waters are being filtered out of the water or the marbles are being filtered out of the water
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_021 it looks like the salt is dissolving into the water but the salt is still there
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_020 they are being mixed together the the sand and dirt are being mixed together
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_027 will become part of the water and it will dissolve into the water
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_008 well in the left pile there are the stuff mixed together the beans mixed together
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_018 they separated so now the water is is pure water and the dirt or the sand is just now sand
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_010 because they are because they are being split apart into into groups that are the same type
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_009 i might call it a solution
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_011 they are they are bring split into parts that are the same
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_013 instead of being mixed they were being separated with their own kind
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_015 they are being separated
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_004 they are all mixed with something
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_007 the first pile is mixed together and the and the second pile is three piles that are the same types
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_003 well they are things mixed together in this in these things
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_030 liquids probably can not be separated unless there iron in it that can be magnetized out but we know that solids can be took out from water
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_031 the grape juice probably can not be separated from the water
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_017 well the sand is a solid so it can not go through paper but the water can leak through paper so it is they are being separated
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_024 the water makes the salt dissolve and the salt dissolves in the water to create the the solution
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_002 we are learning about solutions and mixtures
myst_014027_2013-12-12_12-39-14_MX_1.1_005 well i see marbles and water and i see a salad with all sorts of cool stuff or not cool stuff i see tomatoes and lettuce and stuff
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_028 well we learned about tools a lot more about solutes and solvents
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_005 if there is if there is like if you are trying to make get a rock out of then you can use a magnet to get
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_011 the the important properties that the rock the the water and the like mud in it or whatever is going through and the rock and the pebbles are staying on top
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_006 you are separating the rocks or the pebbles from the water
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_002 we have been talking about mixtures and solutions
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_026 that that the the salts will stay there and the water will go away
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_007 that the rock can not go through the screen but the water can so it is freshening up the water
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_027 think it is a mixture
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_015 the mixtures maybe
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_014 a a and a solute
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_008 the rocks stay on top and the water go through to the other cup
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_025 that use that one because the the the sand the water would evaporate but the salts would stay there
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_013 well for this one we are using to separate them
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_004 you could evaporate it
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_012 that the that the magnet took up the safety pins
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_018 because each one has different properties
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_016 because of particle size
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_017 get something with and we can use a magnet to get it out
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_024 cause the little pebbles can not go through it
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_003 that a mixture is when you mix something mix one mix one thing with another thing
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_022 because because of particle size to get the rocks on top and the water through
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_023 that because the little rock the the little tiny pebbles can not go through the paper but the water can leak through it
myst_014027_2013-12-19_12-31-48_MX_1.3_021 that the rocks stay on top or the pebbles stayed on top and the water went through
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_012 this is this cup is full with one thousand milliliters inside of it and that is one liter i think
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_004 m i do not know
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_024 yesterday in science we used milliliters to see how many milliliters would fill up one meter
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_001 very good i am very very good
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_018 it is just marking the spot
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_015 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_003 we have not been working with an empty cup
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_009 they would not be good vials to use because one is bigger than the other and then someone would say well this cup is let us say six vials and then group two would say no it is eleven
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_010 it would not really work because if they are different sizes then you will get different answers than other people
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_027 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_005 cu that the cup can hold that many vials of water inside of it
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_029 you could use a syringe
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_014 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_008 e group one is bigger than group two
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_028 there is a one thousand milliliters in one liter
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_006 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_025 one is bigger than the other so the big one table one group one has has four vials and four vials can fill up eighty-eight milliliters in group two there is nine vials and eighty and nine vials can fill eighty-eight mil milliliters i think
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_011 i do not really remember talking about that in class so i do not know
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_021 there are one thousand milliliters in one liter
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_026 how much water there is in a cup or how much juice or something
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_002 well feels we have been talking about volume and other stuff
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_020 there is one thousand milliliters filled up in that
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_017 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_007 you could use vials
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_022 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_018 i do not really understand that i do not know how they can be different or the same
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_009 you noticed that it is not filled all the way to the top it is only filled mostly to the top but not all the way
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_006 the soda inside of the soda can only fills up to three hundred and thirty-three milliliters capacity
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_014 the the volume is how much liquid is actually in the soda can and the capacity is how tall the sodi soda can is and how much water it can water or liquid it can hold actually hold
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_007 you look on the bottom of the soda can and it says three hundred milliliters of soda is in there
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_005 well we were seeing if ha if the if the soda in the soda can fills up to the very tippy top or a little bit lower we noticed that it fills up a little bit lower because if you open it up then things will start the w the liquids will start flowing out
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_021 fifty milliliters fifty milliliters forty-two milliliters equals one hundred and forty-two milliliters that is what it says on the screen
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_011 there is well three hundred milliliters of liquid inside of the soda can
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_019 there is a syringe and i do not know what the thing in the middle is but the top is one liter
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_004 capacity is on is when only three hundred and thirty-three milliliters can fill up like a soda can or something
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_012 the liquid of the volume is three hundred milliliters and three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three milliliters capacity of the soda can
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_017 you usually do not fill a cup of water all the way up like sometimes you do with other things like if you are cooking and it says one cup of water you have to get it all the way to the top so you are so what you are making works out
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_010 the printed number is telling you that the amount of soda that is in that can is three hundred milliliters
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_002 we have been doing a lovas a lot of subtraction and it is very very fun
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_023 i would use a syringe instead of something else
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_024 well actually before i did that i would i would see how tall the can is or the cup that you are using i want to do it after i would not measure the campacity after i do it before
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_015 so they are usually pretty they are not like far away from each other they are by to each other cause if it was like halfway full then you would think someone else drank out of the soda can so they are pretty by to each other but not exactly
myst_996725_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_025 i do not know how you could do that but marnie i am going to go now bye bye
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 you could read the numbers that are above the marks cause that tells you how much it is
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_025 you could look at the line and whatever number is across that line you read it and then you know
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_010 i do not know about that yet
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026 the s the the red part goes down or up but if it stays then it is not changing
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 you could use a thermometer fahrenheit or celsius
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 we looked at it and then we recorded it on a paper
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 well when i did it i used a thermometer
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_020 you could use the thermometer or your fingers fi your fingers are not the best way to but it is one way
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 it is little squares it has got the area in the
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_015 i do not know what the that is
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_008 i do not so i think it says it went from twenty to fifteen to ten to five
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_019 a couple of minutes
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 it gets colder
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027 whatever is in the water the merterials ice hot water that makes it change
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_002 we have mostly been doing multiplication and and subtraction
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_017 so you know when it changes or so you know when it changes
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 it took a little whi it took a tali it took a little while for the temperature to start changing you had to wait a couple of minutes but after a while it started changing and it was pretty cool watching it change and it is fun
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_001 it is going very good
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 it is going down or up
myst_996725_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 how cold it is
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_002 in math we have been doing multiplication and we are doing a lot of fun stuff in math
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_011 well you can if you are trying to see how many centimeters is this piece of wood long well some people say that your pinkie finger is about the width of it is about a centimeter so you could measure your pinkie finger next to the piece of wood
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_005 they are all from the metric system
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_016 you can well i do not know
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_019 so you can get better at it
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_018 well when you practice you need to practicing is doing something over and over and over until you get it
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_023 if i am going to make a salad then i have to estimate i probably need let us see maybe five leaves of salad or five things
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_004 it looks like from the bottom of the door to the doorknob
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_001 i am very good
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_008 well i see the number one thousand, one hundred and ten and it seems like the metric system is as high as it can go is to one thousand and as low as it can go is twenty
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_013 estimating is it is very yeah you are pretty much just guessing like what you said and you are not exactly knowing it but you know it after you measure it so yeah
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_014 your the pinkie the width of it is about a centimeter so that would help you or you could say my arm is one foot long then you could use your arm or if you know something or your foot my foot is half a foot so half a ruler so that is yeah
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_017 you could practice more often or do something that is easier and then keep on building up to what you need
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_003 sometimes a desk can be as tall as a meter or a printer or other stuff
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_012 sometimes you do not get the right results and sometimes you do but estimating is just about like trying to think like if i estimate and then i measure my estimation with a ruler or something then i can see if it is wrong i can say so next time i look at this i know it is one foot long
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_009 you can estimate
myst_996725_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_006 it is it is just not using feet or inches and you can measure lots of different stuff using the metric system
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_005 well some of the the the metal is probably the heaviest because it is metal and the the plastic chip right here is probably the lightest and the wood is probably in the middle
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_002 yesterday we we did we took the s scale thingy i forgot what it is called and we meas and zero measurement actually wait
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_007 the the the metal disk is heavier than the plastic disk
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_012 the the metal disk is heavier than the plastic disk so it is going down it is falling down and the plastic disk is getting pushed up
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_021 these are paper clips
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_028 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010 well whichever one is is heavier your hand will be will feel heavier but if it is lighter so it will not feel as heavy as the other hand
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_015 you can measure instead of estimating
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_023 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_017 well the balance is right now it is balanced but if something is heavier than the other then it will drop and it will not be leveled
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_029 that the that the stuff we u the materials that we used were heavier
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_009 well you could put one in your hand and then the other in your hand and see which one is heaviest and if it is the heaviest it goes first if th if it is the lightest it goes last and if it is in the middle then it goes in the middle
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_003 yesterday we measured which one was the heaviest and which one is the lightest and which one is in the middle
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_014 well if you are holding a wood chip and then you take a piece of bark off the tree there you will say well i know this wood chip is about th one or something like that and this wood bark is feels about one so they are both the same weight
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008 plastic should be lighter than metal
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_006 well the the wood chip is probably like a little piece of bark so it is not that heavy but the but the plastic disk is weighs less because it is plastic and the metal disk weighs more because it is made out of metal so it kind of only depends on what they are made out of
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_025 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_022 i would not use paper clips cause one paper clip in can be taller like group one is paper clip was smaller and group two is was bigger so it is heavier
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_024 one of the measuring tools that they were using like maybe they used a paper clip the paper clip has to be heavier so they got different results
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_004 well with the materials that they are made with and the if they are made out of metal or plastic or wood like the things on the screen
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_019 that the the metal the metal chip is heavier than the plastic chip because it is it is more because it is made out of metal and metal is heavier than plastic
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_020 the balance and maybe my hands
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_011 you could get a scale and put one in on end and one on in on the other and whichever one drops down is the heaviest
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_018 because if like you are wearing a bracelet on one of your hands then it is going to be then your hand is going to be heavier and another hand does not have a bracelet then it will not be leveled
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_016 as you put more paper clips in it starts to get more leveled out and it is so first paper clip was too light was too light second paper clip is still too light the third paper clip was still too light and then the fourth one made the plastic disk level so they are both straight
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_013 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_026 it says that something equals one group
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020 say that again
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_022 maybe you need to know how how how heavy it is for a recipe or something in a cookbook
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_011 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_003 we have been using the metric system
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_034 you could like a brick or something that is heavier than one hundred grams or nine hundred grams or something like that
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_002 we have not been doing any measurement in math
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_021 cause maybe you do not have enough small gram pieces and it will not measurement straightly
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_036 i have to go goodbye marnie
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_015 know what a reference is yet
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_028 you nee i do not know
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_023 i have no idea
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_033 you use it to measure something that is too heavy to use for grams
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_024 the the the grams the twenty grams the ten grams the five grams and the one grams are not enough to level out the orange
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_035 heavier than heavier than a book
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_019 one yellow piece is five grams one red piece is ten grams one hundred and twenty piece is twenty grams and the little blue piece one gram
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_007 it tells me that the wood chip is three grams
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_012 grams they he help you measure stuff like if you put a book in and in a cup and you and the book is let us say thirty grams the weight then then it is
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_014 think about like what you think how what you think how heavy it is or tall it is or the length of it or the width
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_005 the little piece of wood on the red cup equals three grams
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_013 you can estimate how tall or how much they weigh
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_030 so they measure exactly one hundred grams
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_025 get a one hundred gram piece or use a different thing than a balance beam
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018 you need seventy grams to measure this car to make it completely measured
myst_996725_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_031 i have not learned about kilograms yet
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_010 measuring is when well
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_011 measuring is when you have to measure how long something is or
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_001 hi my name is sylvie
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017 how long it is or how
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_009 in math we are doing a lot of subtraction and i can not really remember other stuff
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_021 one is longer than the other but i have to go right now
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_002 hi my name is sylvie my birthday is february twenty and i was born two and i am eight years old
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_004 i i pressed the repeat button
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_018 maybe if you need like a piece of paper to go over your desk you have to measure how long the desk is so you can tell how long the paper needs to be
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_016 this looks like inches or centimeters across the table
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_012 i would be trying to figure out how long or tall it is
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_006 yes i do get that
myst_996725_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_013 you might be seeing if something is larger than another thing or how tall it is or if you need to measure like an ingredient to put into a recipe
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_014 i do not know how much a syringe can hold
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_018 to see how much water can fill up so it goes from ten to twenty to thirty to forty to fifty to sixty to seventy to eighty to ninety to one hundred
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_011 i think it is called a syringe
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_015 up to fifty-eight
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_022 i do not know how we would describe that
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_005 i do not know how i figured out volume
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_025 i do not know what you could do if you did not have that i am just guessing nothing
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_030 the second cup is does not have as much water in it as the first cup
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_007 we did not really do anything about a cylinder or a syringe
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_017 i do not know i never worked with this the other day so
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_031 i do not know about capacity
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_024 we could measure the volume of the container
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_016 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_002 well actually yesterday i was not there for science so i do not know
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_027 that is too hard i do not know
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_013 well if you get water into the syringe and it goes up to this line and there is the number twenty-eight next to it it is twenty-eight milliliters or whatever wha or whatever
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_026 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_004 i do not know i was not here yesterday in science
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012 i did not use a syringe
myst_996725_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_020 i do not know what you do with that tool
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_005 i do not know
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_002 you can use a measure tape or a ruler or a meter stick or a yard stick or a feet or inches
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_016 i do not know i do not really understand this question but
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_008 you can use a measuring tape or a ruler or a meter stick or the metric system something from the metric system
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_010 blah blah blah okay well a measuring tape is easier to use than a meter stick well actually no a meter stick is easier to use than a measuring tape cause if you put it up to your wall then it will stay but if you put a measuring tape up to the wall it will not stick so yeah and you just measure stuff with it
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_030 that it is one centimeter long
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_013 well you put a meter stick on the table and then it showed me that a little bit of the table was one meter and then there is a ruler on the table and that shows that there is twenty-three meters so the table is one meter and twenty-three meters centimeters long
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_017 well if you measure it one time and you are and you think you are wrong you could try again
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_026 for that i use a measuring tape so it was easier than using a meter stick
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_031 so you can use it when you do not have a ruler or something
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_028 you need to think about how how many inches or centimeters your hand is
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_006 there is a little boy with a a one hundred and eighteen centimeter measuring tape and he is holding it up to the wall and he is measuring his height
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_024 he is two meters tall it says and he is arm span from finger tip to finger tip
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_018 so you can just double check to make sure you are right
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_021 it was very very very good and easy
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_032 pinkie is one centimeter long so if you keep on doing that then you know something is like three centimeters long
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_011 the metric system a ruler a measuring tape and there is other stuff
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_003 well meter tape is you can like measure around your wrist but with the meter stick you can stick it next to something to see how tall it is or yeah
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_029 the hand is pinkie finger is one cedime centimeter long so he so now he knows that the width of his pinkie finger is a centimeter
myst_996725_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_004 well if we use a hand you do not know how big your hand is and a meter tape you can go it is it is you can go you can go around stuff and it is easier
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_018 you could go and you could see so you know the wet sp the dry the wet sponge is sixteen grams and the dry sponge is let us say it is only three grams but the you could see how how heavier the the wet sponge is from the dry sponge
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008 when it sucks up all the water out of the cup
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_012 there is a sponge in one side of the balance and there is not anything in the other cup so that is why it is not balanced out
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_019 well you have the dry sponge and you know how much the dry sponge weighs then you can figure out the water how heavy the water is by seeing how heavier the wet sponge is from the dry sponge
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_015 the wet sponge is heavier than the dry sponge cause the wet sponge sponge has a lot of water in it
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004 esterday we well we yesterday we we took a balance and we meas we said that a dry sponge is is two
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_003 okay so the these there is the sponge on the far left is a dry sponge in a cup the sponge in the middle is a wet sponge and the sponge on the far right is a soaked sponge
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_006 soaked sponge is a sponge so when you put a sponge in a water it it sucks up all the water so it gets heavier and then it is heavier than it was when it was dry
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009 when a sponge is dry it is not as heavy as it is when it is wet like i said the the sponge in water it sucks up all the water but not in water it does not have any water to suck up so it is just sucking up air which is really nothing
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_014 the the dry sponge e equals three grams cause it is leveled out on the balance
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_011 you put it on a balance and then you just keep on putting
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005 well it is dry so it is not as heavy as a sponge with that was wet so it is pretty light
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_022 which one is heavier than the other
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_013 well see the two cups to without anything in them would just be leveled out but with the sponge in em in one of the cups it makes the other cup lighter
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_017 the wet sponge is sixteen grams
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_001 it is going very well
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_002 we have not been using much measurement but we have been balancing things like we have been using a balance
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_021 the sponge held thirteen grams of water
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_016 the dry sponge equals three grams
myst_996725_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_010 you can put the a sp a sponge on one of the sides of the balance and then after you put that you can keep on weighing it and see how much it is and then when it is when it is when it is wet it will weigh a lot more cause it has water inside of it that makes it more heavy cause water is heavier than just a normal sponge
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_015 s so you do not have to put your finger in and say this one is warmer than that one no this one is it is just too complicated to just used your finger it is easier to use a thermometer
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_025 well i never figured that out
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_022 that it is not it is not as it is not as warm as the fifty it is forty the warm water is forty degrees celsius more warm than ten
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_014 i think the unit is called celsius
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_010 sometimes your finger can be sometimes your finger can be warm and the thermometer a thermometer works better because your finger could be a different temperature and it would be easier to use a thometer
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_018 that it is not as cold hot i mean
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 maybe maybe b is the warmest and c is the coldest and a is the same temperature as b
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_017 well if the thom thermometer goes up to at least like a one hundred degrees celsius then you know it is hot but if it goes all the way down to seven it is not as it is freezing then we would not have school i would be here if it were below fifty below zero
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_019 hot water is warmer than ice water because ice is in the water
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008 to see how hot cold or warm something is
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_024 you could estimate
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_006 one is warmer or hotter than the other
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_013 c is twenty degrees celsius b is zero degrees celsius and a is twenty degrees celsius so c and a are the same temperature
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_021 well you are pouring ice water into warm water but you do not know what you are going to get
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_005 was trying to figure out which one is the warmest and which one is the coldest and which one is in the middle
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016 i do not know that question the answer to that question but maybe later i will
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_023 it would get warm and cold the ice water would make the warm water colder but the warm water would make the ice water warmer
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_003 one of the one of the water one of the cup was cup c was coldest cup b was warmest and cup and no cup c was coldest one of the cup was coldest one of the cup was and two of the cups were the same
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_026 okay so fifty degrees celsius ten degrees celsius put together equals thirty degrees celsius
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_011 because fingers do not work
myst_996725_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 it measures the weight or temperature or length of something
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_030 it has steel in it
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_025 the steel nail is sticking to the magnet
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_014 in the wood block is not sticking to the magnet is because not made of iron or steel
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_005 magnets only can stick to anything may as steel or iron
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_004 magnets magnets only can stick to iron or steel
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_016 the steel nail the nail is made of steel and iron and the wood blocks not made of steel or iron
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_010 can you repeat that
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_008 the refrigerator is made of iron or steel
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_021 because not all metals is made of iron or steel but iron just steel nail are made by iron
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_034 i think we learned today it has to stick to magnets it has to be made of steel or
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_015 steel iron anything that made those two material would stick to magnet
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_017 because magnet only stick to iron and steel
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_006 can you repeat that
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_026 the black rock sticks because it has iron in it over it
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_007 it is sticking to the refrigerator
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_032 because it has steel
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_031 it has iron and steel in it
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_019 that the steel nail is sticking and aluminum is not because the steel is made of iron and the aluminum is not
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_011 can you repeat that
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_022 iron and the steel nail
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_028 stick to the magnet
myst_007083_2014-04-10_13-09-27_EE_3.1_027 the gray what rock would not work because they has no iron
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_015 there was no sound
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_022 i see a apples a candle wood and a fuel can
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_013 it is melting
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_028 because they both do energy
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_007 energy is important because you need energy to power everything in your house
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_036 cannot use it any more
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_029 can you repeat that because they always talking
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_021 i can hear sound
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_018 there is sound energy
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_005 it is burning
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_033 are you married
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_030 because the gas and coal burn and they make fire
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_035 because that give us energy and are you married
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_032 it will pollute the air
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_008 the energy is like a fuel
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_026 because the solar and a windmill the wind takes wind makes it energy in the solar panel makes the energy from the sun and those two
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_003 and the candle was melting
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_009 it is notice
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_037 nonrenewable is means that you can not use it again
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_034 it will pollute the air are you married
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_020 can you repeat that again
myst_007083_2014-03-07_11-07-49_EE_1.4_038 marine are you married to someone in my school
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_021 the switch has to be closed on to the
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_016 circuit is close
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_019 switch is of the metal if the energy stops moving then it has to go back to battery but if its closed then it has it can come
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_017 energy is flowing to the motor
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_028 the for the solar panel to run to make energy the sun has to be out
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_033 when i click on the sun ah it doesn t code the motor
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_026 the panel is icon is receiver but it s like a battery
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_003 motor is running because the d cell is powering
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_006 it uses energy
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_031 the solar cell was stop running
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_024 the ah electricity the switch has to be but when it open
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_004 the energy is flowing through the wires
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_029 is flowing to the motor and its
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_012 switch is touch the switch is touching the metal so that is what the energy is flowing through the metal being going to
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_030 the sun is kind of a like energy source but the energy comes down and heats the solar panel
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_022 note this one the switch is on the metal it s when you take it off
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_037 before it doesn t heat the battery the solar panel but a heats the what you call it
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_010 battery has energy so the wire is taking the energy
myst_007083_2014-02-12_10-01-59_EE_1.2_027 the receiver in a battery at the same time are working together to power it them one
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_019 that is right
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_026 reason the parallel circuit going is better because it has it is own pathway to the power source for each but this will share you the bottom one is shares
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_002 we have been trying to make two light bulbs to light really bright
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_012 it will work better
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_025 there is two power resources
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_004 can you repeat that
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_021 can you repeat that
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_017 i see it going no use
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_028 they sharing the same flow of energy
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_032 the top right parallel circuit
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_014 they are moving from one light bulb to other light bulb it wasn t working before you not know and its flowing to another light bulb for its flowing through from the battery to the other light bulb to the other light bulb that is all
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_005 hm this is a parallel circuit because it has one battery but four wire
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_031 parallel circuit in the top right
myst_007083_2014-03-18_09-04-04_EE_2.2_010 they each of their own pathway
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_028 when touching one of the d cells around it will start working again
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_015 multiple and tons of energy flows to other comes to the light bulbs one light bulb get another didn t come back
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_012 that is the energy
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_007 it makes that complete
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_005 energy is flowing from the battery to the light
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_026 if it once it done both goes out one of them goes out then you have to face another one
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_029 if two of the same side are together it won t work
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_018 you need more power source
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_010 it flowing through the two light bulbs
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_030 don t put two batteries together on the same side
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_006 energy has to be flowing through it
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_023 it gives the more energy
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_001 amazing i just had a test
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_020 that they get dimmer
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_027 because and plus are touching together
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_011 electricity flowing through this one other wire takes the energy goes to the other one then it flows to other when comes to the other one
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_019 the light bulbs are gained
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_025 the candle is melt one of the light bulbs are brighter than the other and there is a checking
myst_007083_2014-03-12_09-34-12_EE_2.1_009 if you have two receivers you need two more batteries to heat the source of it
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_032 if the energy flows a different way
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_009 the battery is a like a
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_010 a light bulb needs power
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_033 positive the minus side
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_014 they make the flow the energy travels throungh them to power
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_007 the battery in the light bulb one
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_028 blue dots represent as energy
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_011 the source of energy means that its stores energy
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_037 there will be no energy flowing through it
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_005 the wires if you put them into the battery they were you make to transfer the energy
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_023 electricity is flowing toward the light bulb
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_035 because that the part minus side is flowing out energy is flowing out the minus side and the energy is coming back in the plus side
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_030 it flipped around ten therefore energy is flowing towards positive sign and coming out through other end
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_024 the electricity flows its stored in the light bulb then it one something had to it goes out of it and
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_027 flows into the positive side
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_038 i know that on the sides if one of the wires on the bottom and it will light up but it is did both on the bottom they will not
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_034 it is flowing behind the it s flowing from the positive side and its flowing back into the main part no
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_017 it means that it receive the energy
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_031 the light bulb goes off then it turns around then energy comes out where the positive side was
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_036 can you repeat
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_021 because there is energy flowing through it
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_020 the electricity that goes into the light bulb is ah to powering the filament
myst_007083_2014-02-05_12-26-52_EE_1.1_012 it provides energy
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_022 i do not think this plant has gotten any oxygen
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_013 i think that this picture shows that all plants needs sunlight to survive
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_015 that their food in a way is liquid so it can move throughout the cells
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_006 that yeast is single celled and does not have a mouth or anything
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_012 i think that this picture show that all plants need oxygen or some form of air to survive
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_002 we have been looking at different patterns in the circulatory system
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_009 what happens to the plant and what it needs to grow and how it grows
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_007 we were growing to see how it how it is affected by how much light it has
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_023 it did not let it say breathe meaning it could not get any air into its leaves or let it flow throughout
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_027 the plant has everything it needs it has the water to help everything move out the sun so it can get its energy and the oxygen so it does not dry out
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_021 well there is a thing in leaves called chlorophyll and absorbs the sunlight and reflects off green meaning this did not get any sunlight so it can not reflect off green
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_016 it shows a home but plants do not necessarily need a home
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_026 the plant has everything it needs
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_008 one was not put into light os it did not get the same nutrients as the healthy one
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_003 we were seeing if yeast liked four or sugar more
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_029 producers are important because they do not need to eat anything else and they can lead up to other things that might need to eat these producers it also shows
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_020 this maybe shows that the plant did not get all the things it needs to make its food so it did not survive
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_030 today we talked about how plants are producers and they make their own food and they also need many types of things like water oxygen and light to survive
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_014 i think that this shows that the plants need some from of food or maybe some form of nutrients
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_025 the plant has not been getting any water meaning none of its food can move throughout its body
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_017 it is showing that nutrients as in water is being absorbed through the roots and it is absorbing the light energy and it also collects the carbon dioxide and sends out the oxygen that it does not need
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_011 i think this plant does because most plants do need water to survive
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_004 i think this shows like uhm how yeast releases gas as it eats
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_010 the picture shows it needs soil light and water
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_018 i think they need sunlight so they can still remain green and have all the necessary nutrients they may need water because to stay hydrated as all things need they need oxygen so they can say breathe
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_019 they collect sunlight and they transfer that and they make it into sugar which they press through the cells this is called photosynthesis
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_024 this plant has everything that it needs but water which helps
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_005 it is showing what happens when it when yeast eats when yeast eat
myst_022209_2015-01-15_11-40-45_LS_2.1_028 it shows that the plants do not need to make do not need to eat anything so they do not so there is nothing leading up to them they are not eating anything on the food webs
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_013 oxygen getting into our blood and carbon dioxide getting out
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_008 it comes in through the mouth and nose and is filtered
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_016 air is dragged in through the mouth and the nose and it is brought down through the trachea
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_010 i think the main organ is the lung
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_018 the diaphragm does all the work by retracting and expanding
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_009 inhaling is bringing in exhaling is sending out
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_003 we were learning about the respiratory system
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_007 breathing helps us get oxygen in and carbon dioxide out
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_014 so we do not have random gases in our blood
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_015 i believe e does
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_006 this shows how air gets into the lungs and how it gets out of the lungs
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_002 covering a lot of different things in science
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_005 i can see there are many different parts of the system and they all do different things that are very important
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_011 when it moves it either causes low pressure or high pressure to get air in or out
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-37-34_LS_3.3_004 i think these are all the parts of the respiratory system
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_007 maple leaf it could be a maple leaf
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_016 it shows water being released from leave
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_013 i think the nutrients and water and food travel through the veins on leaves
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_011 i think the veins are for carrying nutrients around
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_008 palmate it has palmate veins
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_006 it is it has parallel veins
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_015 i think it transports fluid and oxygen like the circulatory system in humans
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_012 i think this shows what plants need to make food
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_002 earlier we were talking about the vascular system in plants
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_014 i think this is showing what goes on in the middle of the leaf
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_003 they all have a different shape
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_010 leaf has penny veins
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_004 they all have different types of vein
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_001 i am doing all right
myst_022209_2015-01-30_11-30-41_LS_3.1_005 i think this is a blade of
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_010 i think this shows nerves in the brain
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_022 turning our food into nutrients
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_008 that they are showing a type of cell and a part of a leg
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_024 it chews and breaks down foods before it heads down to the esophagus
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_015 that we have different parts of cells and there is a lot
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_019 it shows a butterfly is digestive system as well as a human
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_007 this only shows one section as does it with humans
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_021 the human digestive system
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_017 it shows a butterfly which is perhaps made out of many cells
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_009 they are very long enough to be grouped together or we would not have a muscle
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_002 we have been learning about different systems
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_030 we were comparing cells with humans and yeast and that showed uhm how one thing could be maybe a single celled thing and the other one could be multi celled then we went through how humans have different cells and that make up different parts and then finally we went through how the digestive system works and how maybe a butterfly can have the same
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_013 these cells are important because they make up a very important part of our body
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_012 i think this shows another part of an arm some cells
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_005 it shows different cells and how they are grouped
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_016 i think maybe the human has more cells because it needs to make up a larger thing
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_020 they both have a stomach and a way of getting rid of their waste
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_025 it pushes down food into the stomach with some strong muscles
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_004 we are learning about different cells and we did a yeast experiment a few times ago
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_011 it is showing me brain cells
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_026 i know that this is vital so the chewed up food can get into the stomach and so can so the food can be break down even further
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_029 they are the longest part of the digestive system
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_028 the small intestine removes nutrients while the large intestine removes moisture
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_014 we are made of many cells and lots of different types of cells even
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_006 plant cells are layered differently than regular human cells
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_003 these look like cells
myst_022209_2015-01-22_11-03-49_LS_2.3_018 it shows a butterfly which may be made out of many different cells as we are
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_003 you are using grape juice and and there is one more concentrated and one is less concentrated
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_011 the darker colors are more concentrated than the lighter colors and the lighter colors are more dilute
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_009 we use taste
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_010 one has more powder and one has less powder
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_017 it is different cause one is more stronger and it is more concentrated and that makes it strong and the ones that is more dilute is not strong
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_016 it would taste more watery
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_018 you could add more water
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_001 i am doing good
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_012 it is more dilute
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_008 you can determine them by which is more more concentrated and which is more dilute
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_013 can you repeat that
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_002 we have been studying salt solution
myst_014033_2014-01-15_12-46-05_MX_2.1_007 you can tell it by weighing it if one is more concentrated or one is less concentrated
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_035 it is considered a solution
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_021 that it is a correct addition problem
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_027 i noticed that the salt dissolved
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_023 you can evaporate the
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_028 this means that the i mean salt is still there
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_010 solutions are different from mixtures because when you mix like salt and water together the salt disappears or dissolves but when you mix like let us say a fruits with vegetables it is like a salad it does not none of them disappear they just stay
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_034 this is an example of a solution
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_016 the important fact is that when you when you add a material together your product would be like the same
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_044 bye you have a nice day too
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_013 well i noticed that ten twenty twenty equals fifty so when you so each of them is like one thousand and twenty and twenty and when you plus you add it altogether it is fifty
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_031 it is actually a mixture
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_012 we call that solvent
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_043 we have learned about solutions and when you mix salt and water together it keeps it keeps its same mass that is called conservation and then also we learned that we take the salt the water out that is evaporation and the salt is still there so we can prove that the salt has not totally disappeared that it just dissolved
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_003 those are different kind of solutions like with i mean salt and water mixed together is salt water and with sand and water mixed together it is like sand water
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_014 i noticed that when you plus water with salt it equals salt water and salt water would be heavier than water cause it has the salt in
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_006 well the sand mixture when you do that it the water turns all brown and the sand some of the sand just stays but when you mix the salt and water together the salt dissolves
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_038 it is evaporating so you can see the salt the salt is still there
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_029 it is considered a solution
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_002 well we were learning about solutions
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_040 that you can evaporate the water and the thing will still be there but when you evaporate it it is not the same as putting it through a filter
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_018 it is increasing
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_032 you can only get it out in a mixture but you can in a solution if if it is like salt and water you can evaporate it
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_039 it is evaporating i told you several times
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_025 i think it is the property of a solution
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_033 that is a solution because the citric acid stayed in the water when you put it through the filter and it did not stay go in the cup
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_020 the mass increases by fifteen
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_019 none of the elements change it is like the weight does not change it just adds to the so the when the solute goes into a solvent the the weight the weight adds together to make the final solution
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_001 i am doing good
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_008 the water is plain and the grape it the grapetastic thing is plain the salt
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_011 the solvent is the water
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_015 it tells me that all them the weights stay the same in the properties chart
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_030 that is a mixture cause they kept the same properties it is a mixture cause it kept the same property
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_005 so the sand is going into the water and the salt is going into the to the water and the salt is dissolving
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_007 the salt dissolved and that is important because you know that salt is a dissolving material
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_036 you can evaporate it
myst_014033_2013-12-12_13-04-20_MX_1.2_004 we call that a solvent
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_025 because there is only two stuff and you can separate them very easily and water goes through the filter and you have asked this me lots of times and can you please do not ask me this question again thank you very much
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_013 it was particle size and magnetism
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_004 that you can separate them
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_001 i am doing good
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_015 properties to separate mixtures
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_012 the important property is magnetism
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_022 because all the other particles can go through but the big rocks can not go through
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_021 it is important because the bigger size can not go through the screen
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_028 it is a solution
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_024 you used a filter because i do not know maybe cause you used it with a screen i do not know wait i do not know
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_003 we can separate a mixture by using magnetism
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_010 the important property is particle size
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_019 what i did not hear you
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_006 well the mixture is with gravel and water but when you pour it through a screen only the water goes through the gravel stays on the screen
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_007 it is trying to show me that the property size of water
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_020 because magnet has magnetism and paper clips stick to magnets
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_026 can we please move on to the next
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_005 you could use density magnetism
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_016 because they are solids
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_030 can you close now
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_002 well we have been studying how to separate a solution
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_027 that you are separating the
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_017 because water would not work cause there is more than one thing and only the paper clips would stick to that so that is an excellent way to separate them
myst_014033_2013-12-18_12-55-53_MX_1.3_018 because all mixtures are different
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_002 we have been doing citric acid and calcium chloride and baking soda well chemical reaction
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_005 that those two things make salt
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_003 that is called a chemical reaction
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_015 the one with the bag closed is weighs more than the one with the bag open because the one with the bag open when the chemical reaction happened it let go of gases that made and the one with the bag closed kept the gases so therefore it weighs more
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_012 can you repeat that please
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_008 a chemical reaction no i am sorry i am just let us see just forget what i said forget
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_016 because one kept the glasses gases and one kept did not keep gases i told you seven times
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_014 the one with the bag opened let out gas and the one with the bag closed sealed the gas
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_007 the water went up and down that is a product and the on the product is the salt that is on the bottom of the bag when you mix those two together and you put them in a solvent that makes salt and then you evaporate it to find out what it is and then you identify it by the crystal chart and you find chart
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_009 those two chemicals make whatever that is well they mix together and then
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_011 when you add two chemicals and they weigh a certain amount and you mix them in with something else you get the product
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_006 we mix two solutes together and the put em in a solvent and they made a chemical reaction
myst_014033_2014-02-06_12-39-42_MX_4.2_010 it is a chemical reaction
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_007 can we were learning about solutions can we learn about solutions now
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_011 actually we were actually learning about solutions and not
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_010 they separate and they do not make a mixture hello
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_002 well we were being we were working on solutions and we mixed some water with salt and we wanted to see if it would actually you know disappear when we did and then so we evaporated it and then we also waited so we could find out if it evaporated or not
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_004 they are just stuff mixed together but they keep their same properties
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_009 i would call the water and sand and salt and sand solutions but the wood chips and paper clips are mixtures
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_003 well a mixture is something that if you mix it together it keeps it is same properties but a solution is when they do not keep their same properties and we were learning about solutions
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_005 well the trail mix just is m and ms nuts and raisins and then the salad is just a bunch of fruits and vegetables mixed together and then the paper clips and i do not know what that is are mixed together and the marbles are mixed together
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_008 it is a mixture and they keep zero my
myst_014033_2013-12-12_12-59-25_MX_1.1_006 can we learn about solutions now
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_013 can you show me the chart again please
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_004 well we have been putting different things in different
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_010 by seeing how long it takes to saturated
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_006 one gets saturated faster
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_008 kind of already explained that
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_007 that is kinda what i just said
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_009 they are trying to saturate
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_012 i do not know cause you need to show me the chart again i think it is salt though
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_003 well we have been working with salt solutions
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_005 well one can be saturated
myst_014033_2014-01-29_12-31-47_MX_3.2_011 can you show me the chart again
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_023 it has made a new molecule
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_031 the two mixtures the two solutions have created a product that is pink
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_004 it had a chemical reaction
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_046 it has made a chemical reaction
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_033 yes because the product turned pink
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_005 they are reactant
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_014 it has separated
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_009 i think so because baking soda when it hit when it hits water it fizzes
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_020 baking soda and calcium chloride
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_035 he made a poop in the
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_045 yes because it is glowing
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_025 i poo my pants
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_029 it got cold
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_003 you are mixing two reactants together to get a product
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_024 there have been purple molecules created in the water
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_015 they mix together and separate
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_008 we mix calcium chloride baking soda and then calcium chloride and citric acid and then finally baking soda and citric acid
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_048 yes because the grape the water has turned purple
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_026 it can not be separated because it is inside of the water
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_021 the solution has left a precipitate
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_001 good how are you
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_007 the solvent and the solute
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_016 they are mixed to create a new molecule
myst_012030_2013-12-20_09-10-55_MX_4.1_018 they will mix together and create a chemical reaction
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_028 it is a mixture because the gravel the sand can not mix with the the water because it can not dissolve
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_040 yes we do know that
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_033 you have to evaporate the solvent and then then you have the solute
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_006 the sand and the water mixture can not dissolve the sand can not dissolve it just stays there and with the salt it can dissolve in the water
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_017 the mass is getting greater
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_009 i do not
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_037 you can evaporate the water so you can separate the solute
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_010 a solution is different from other mixtures because one item has dissolved into the other item
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_007 the salt has dissolved and it is an important because that is how we can make salt water
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_031 it is considered a solution
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_002 i have been learning zero yeah how to graph stuff on the computer like yeah with using
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_019 it gains mass
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_018 the water is fifty grams and the salt is fifteen grams and if you add them it equals sixty-five grams
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_015 if you mixed a solute and a salt then you will the weight of the solute and the weight of the other item will will still add up to be
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_016 it it is all added up and a new weight
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_034 the water is evaporating
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_022 you can use a coffee filter or you can evaporate the water from the salt
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_004 the water plus the salt equals salt water that is the solution
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_003 water plus salt er yeah water plus the powdery salt equals salt water that is the solution and then water plus sand is equals of brown solution mixture
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_024 it is a mixture
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_021 i do not know
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_038 the water is evaporating and so it is important because you can separate the solute from the
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_023 the solute the solution was flour a mixture of flour and water but when you put it through the coffee filter then the flour can not go through because the grains are too big and the water can just slip right through the holes
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_035 it the water is dissolving
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_020 the water has gained fifteen grams of salt and therefore it is sixty grams of saltwater
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_012 the end result is that all of the components are mixed together and twenty twenty is forty and then ten forty is fifty
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_014 the salt dissolved but it becomes part of the water so it still adds weight
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_025 i know right so the nothing has gone through because it is
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_027 it is considered a solution
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_029 it has turned into a mixture
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_030 it is a solution because the citric acid has blended into the water
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_013 fifty grams of water fifteen grams of salt equals sixty-five grams of saltwater
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_039 it has created a solution and you can it has created a solution and if you pour it in a dish and you leave it for a long time then over time the salt the solvent evaporates and then the solute stays in the cup
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_041 you can evaporate the water from the solute to separate it
myst_012030_2013-11-14_09-32-57_MX_1.2_032 you have to dissolve the water
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_028 bye thank you
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_024 they are
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_005 they are separating
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_016 they both they all have different materials
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_027 in the delta there is more sand in the desert there is more gravel than sand
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_010 there are these soils are from different strips
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_022 they all have different components and different place
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_021 they separated differently and sand sand and clay are on the top and then gravel is on the bottom
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_026 the delta has more humus and more sand and at the bottom there is a tiny bit of gravel
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_015 all soils are different because they are from different climates
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_018 they are spread out through the gravel
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_023 the desert will have a lot of sand and gravel and not much humus in the farm land there will be a lot of humus some sand and clay and gravel
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_007 i see lots of clay silt gravel and humus
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_025 they are similar because they most of them have sand
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_012 they are all from different places
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_003 we have been learning about soil and soil rocks and land forms
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_006 we have been observing different kinds of soil from different places
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-52-42_SRL_1.1_011 they are all from different places
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_021 listen to my eye
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_031 it was slow
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_026 why do you take so long to talk back
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_035 it was fast
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_013 i told you already
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_015 i already looked at it
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_032 a long time
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_024 a volcanic eruption and why is it going perfect
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_009 there is water with the steep slope and one that is flat
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_018 during the flood it is going really fast
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_012 i kind of already did
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_014 because of water
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_019 it has more energy
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_036 why do you have red hair
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_017 during the flood the water is going really fast when it is normal it is going normal speed
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_006 i really got to go to the bathroom
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-10-53_SRL_2.2_016 the flood is going fast causing more erosion and deposition and normal is
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_004 we have been dissolving salt into we have been trying to saturate a fifty milliliters of water with salt
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_009 the water is getting concentrated
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_012 the water is getting concentrated with sugar
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_011 that means the water can not dissolve anymore salt into it
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_015 the the salt adds weight
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_016 we know that there were fifty milliliters of water seventeen there was sixty-seven grams total of solution and fifty grams equals seventeen grams of solute
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_017 you have to have the same amount of solute
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_014 this salt solution weighs more than fifty milliliters of water because the salt adds weight
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_008 that means the solution is zero my god that means the solution is
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_002 mixtures and solutions
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_003 a solvent and a solute
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_007 it is dissolving the salt and it is getting saturated
myst_012030_2013-12-13_08-37-49_MX_3.1_010 that means the water is saturated
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_009 the water is getting saturated
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_006 the powder is
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_005 that means it is not soluble
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_016 one of the sides is heavier than the other because it is has salt in
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_015 it leaves some of the salt on the bottom
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_017 the salt in the solution is more than fifty grams
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_012 that means the water is saturated
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_018 you put fifty milliliters of water in an empty cup and then added weights to fifty milliliters of water so the fifty milliliters of water canceled out the fifty milliliters of the
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_010 that means the water is saturated
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_011 the epsom salt is dissolving into the water
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_007 you need a solute and a solvent
myst_012030_2013-12-18_09-54-39_MX_3.1_008 we have been making salt solutions
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_015 the flood conditions have made more canyons than the standard conditions
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_013 when i chew gum i make bubbles
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_009 in the one with the steep there is the water is going fast but the one with the flat it is going slow
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_011 the flow of the water that is faster
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_002 we have been learning about rocks soils and land forms
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_004 the one with the slant has created a delta and the one without a slant has created a smaller delta
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_017 the water is flowing really fast during a flood and normal it is going slow compared normal
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_016 during a flood the water goes up higher than it is supposed to
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_018 one is faster than the other
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_020 in two hundred and forty-second the flood has taken down trees and rocks from the land
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_003 we have been making stream tables
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_014 the erosion for the standard conditions has been small and the the one for the large conditions is large
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_010 the water on the flat slope is going slow and the water on the sleep steep slope is going fast
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_005 the stream table with a slope has a bigger fan the one without a slope has a smaller fan
myst_012030_2014-03-10_13-13-13_SRL_2.2_008 a river that is steep it flows down a river that is flat goes slow
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-47-01_MX_4.2_008 the product is the remaining thing at the bottom
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-47-01_MX_4.2_010 water baking soda and calcium chloride
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-47-01_MX_4.2_007 the chemical reactions occurs and the bag expands
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-47-01_MX_4.2_009 baking soda and chemical calcium chloride
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-47-01_MX_4.2_003 there is a chemical reaction occuring
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-47-01_MX_4.2_005 there are salt there are these are salt crystals
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-47-01_MX_4.2_011 all the chemical react
myst_012030_2014-02-10_08-47-01_MX_4.2_004 two reactants combining
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-07-58_SRL_2.1_006 it is on the hill side
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-07-58_SRL_2.1_001 good how are you
myst_012030_2014-03-11_12-07-58_SRL_2.1_004 erosion and deposition
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_015 the freezing jar has cracked the ice because the water has expanded
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_007 i notice that the rock went down through water and was still moving
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_009 the roots are break are going into the rock and are expanding to crack the rock
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_026 because the delta gravel has hit other rocks going down
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_008 abrasion is when the rock hits other rocks and breaks freezing is when water gets into a crack of a rock and starts breaking it the water expands and started breaking it
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_021 the one on the left side
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_002 we are i know cause you did mixtures and solutions you did m x we have been learning about soils rocks and land forms
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_023 when the rocks are in the mountains they get they are big but as they flow down the river they hit other rocks and break into smaller rocks
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_011 when water fills up a crack in the rock and it freezes then the ice the water expands and cracks the rock
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_018 the water expands
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_001 good how are you
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_005 the rock has smashed into other rocks that is called physical weathering
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_019 because the water expands
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_012 when water gets into a crack of the rock it freezes and expands to crack the rock
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_010 the tree roots have grow and have or raised the
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_014 it expands and
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_006 the rock smashed into other rocks
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_028 goodbye thank you i love you will you marry me
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_024 at the top they are pebbles in the middle they turn into gravel and around the end they turn into sand and the final stage is powder
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_020 the pile of rocks at the on the left are pebbles and the and the rocks on the right are gravel
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_016 the water has expanded and broke the glass
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_003 we have been learning about rocks cracking because of weather
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_025 they want on the bottom
myst_012030_2014-03-11_10-35-35_SRL_1.2_013 the water got into the rock and froze and expanded to crack the rock
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_011 you can weigh both solutions using grams and the one that weighs more is more concentrated
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_009 i see that there are three scoops in the first one and then one scoop in the second one
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_003 to make a solution you need a powder that can dissolve into water
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_013 the difference in color
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_014 the darker colored solutions usually have more powder
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_023 add fifty milliliters of water
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_004 the grape powder is getting put into the water to make a solution
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_016 the lighter colored solutions are diluted
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_008 one solution has more grape powder than the other
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_021 it would not be as strong as the one with the more grape powder
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_019 it would be really really strong and it might not be really good for you and the one with one spoonful will be really diluted the one with five spoonfuls will be really really concentrated because it has five spoons of powder
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_018 i think it would taste stronger because the more powder you have the stronger it will be
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_002 solutions and mixtures and solutions
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_022 add fifty milliliters of water to the more concentrated one
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_007 you can weigh it with a scale or you can see look at the difference in color
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_020 it would taste lighter and more diluted
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_017 it does not have as much powder
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_024 you can add more powder or add more water
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_010 the one with more powder is more concentrated and it has more it is darker color than the other one it is less concentrated
myst_012030_2013-12-03_10-12-56_MX_2.1_015 they are more concentrated than the ones with lighter
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_004 they are using a magnet to take out the pins
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_005 they are separating gravel and rocks with a filter
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_019 if we used a coffee filter then there would be tons of stuff like all the sand and the junk in there but when we use the magnet then it just separates it with only the magnets and nothing else
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_024 this is the best for using evaporation to separate the salt from the
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_015 because the gravel can get fit through the screen
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_017 because some tools might not work for some other mixtures like for sand you have to use a coffee filter and for gravel and water you have to use a screen
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_021 because the water can go through it and the gravel can not
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_022 i saw that when you use the coffee filter to separate the powder the water just runs through the filter because it can fit through the little holes and the powder can not
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_003 a mixture is something that you have to separate using evaporation because you can not separate it with a filter
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_007 so you can separate the gravel from the water
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_016 because if you use the screen the paper clips might go through so it is a just get em out really quick you just use a magnet because the the paper clips have magnetite
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_006 gravel and water
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_011 the magnet is sucking up the little pins with magnetite
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_023 we used a filter because the powder can not go through it so the water just separates straight through the filter and it just leaves the powder
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_018 i notice that the when the paper clips are the magnet picked them right up because they are magnetic
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_009 the gravel is being separated from the water using a screen
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_020 i notice that the gravel got separated by the screen because it can not fit through
myst_012030_2013-11-20_09-36-53_MX_1.3_002 we have been talking about separating mixtures
myst_012030_2013-12-18_10-02-26_MX_3.2_003 we have been making solutions and chemical reaction
myst_012030_2013-12-18_10-02-26_MX_3.2_010 one takes more to
myst_012030_2013-12-18_10-02-26_MX_3.2_009 that means it is saturated
myst_012030_2013-12-18_10-02-26_MX_3.2_005 each solute each one of the things is
myst_012030_2013-12-18_10-02-26_MX_3.2_011 we got a piece of paper and we glued it in our science notebook
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_017 you can weigh them
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_020 solution one is the most concentrated and solution three is the least concentrated
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_008 it is more concentrated and it weighs more
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_019 solution one is the most concentrated and solution two is the least concentrated
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_009 one has seventy-five milliliters of water and one has both have seventy-five milliliters of water but the one on the left has ten grams of solute and the one on the right has twenty grams of solute
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_011 one will be heavier because the salt the solute adds weight
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_012 i was correct because the solute adds weight
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_018 solution one is the most concentrated and solution two is the least concentrated
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_016 the grape the grape mix on the the farthest grape mix on the right is the most concentrated grape mix the one on the left is the least concentrated grape mix
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_002 we have been learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_006 the rock is more concentrated than the feather because the feather is two grams and the rock is ninety gram
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_003 we have made salt and water solutions and cool aid solutions
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_007 it weighs more
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_001 how are you
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_010 one cup has one thousand and ten grams more solute
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_015 the grape mix it gets lighter and lighter going to the left the one on the farthest one on the right is more is the most concentrated of the grape mix zero god what
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_013 one has ten more grams of solute than the other
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_004 you can weigh them because the salt adds weight to this water
myst_012030_2013-12-04_09-00-59_MX_2.2_014 the one on the right has more of the solute the one on the left has less and it weighs less
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_028 pushed away because they were aluminum and not iron like the other ones
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_021 what i observed was that the magnets would only connect to iron and it would only connect it would not connect to aluminum it would only connect to iron
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_005 i have it to work
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_017 basically what is going on here is alumi alu aluminum nail is has no iron in it but then next to it it has the steel nail and the steel nail has iron in it so the all mag so a magnet has iron in it too so of course it will connect
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_029 they stick together because they have iron in them but then the two in the middle do not have anything because they are both aluminum
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_027 they are clicking together and that is why they are not working
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_025 they are off zero no never mind that the top ones jordan i have to repeat myself that the top ones were connec were connecting together because they mu they must have had some iron in it or something like that but then the bottom ones must have had some aluminum in it because they were not connecting they were just pushing them together okay bye bye
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_014 well there is rocks actually because there is iron in the rocks and some there is nails but only not the shiny nails the dark nails and then there is this little gold thing that would connect and then there is this kind of copper thing and then a paper clip and those things would all stick together
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_030 bye nice meeting you bye bye
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_022 i see one man two men and their fingers are pointing and the first one right here is pointing pointing to two magnets and then this other man is connecting to one magnet but the other one is not connected
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_018 magnets stick to iron most of the time that is the only thing that magnets will stick to because magnets have iron in them basically and most of the time it will just connect to iron things and that is how both will work
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_010 well we have been studying about the sun and stuff like that
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_013 when we were putting the magnets up the stuff that were magnetic would come would rise a little bit and connect to the magnet that we were trying to make stuff stick to
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_012 w we have observed how it connects to things and how it can stick to other things that are magnetic
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_011 can you repeat that
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_007 yes i do get that marnie
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_016 they connect to things that are magnetic and that have iron in them most of the time
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_023 these interact because you can tell that the the oops that these ones have aluminum in them these ones up here and but then the other ones up here do not they have iron in them so that is why they connected together
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_006 did i what
myst_997690_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_015 can you repeat that please
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_009 the green wire attaches the d cell to the light bulb and the light bulb to the a and b and then back to the light bulb that is how
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_004 if you tried to find the wires like you could do b c a d b d a c a a d c c b b a c d you could also do you could do and then you just try to find you could just try to find anything
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_021 bye we need to go bye
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_008 has ha happen is it has to like it has to run through it and get to the light bulb before it is too late before it is too late do you like pizza
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_003 e piece of cardboard they are are piece of cardboard that you try to there is wires under the cardboard and you try to find what wires can make a light bulb light up and bulb light up
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_005 well there is a complete circuit and a and d work the a and d would work and so they come together and they make magic
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_006 well what is happening is there is the d cell butn there is a d cell and then there is the light bulb and then there is the ba and then there is the wires and then it comes the cardboard with the wires and then the and that is how it that how that is what it makes the light light up
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_007 well what i think is the a since w what i think is it m it makes it light a and b in the situation works and it is try a and b works in this situation and you try to find the wires and what are you getting
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_014 they are made out of metal
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_010 well the it looks like the wires it is a and c it is a and c and it is a and c which and that is how the light bulb lights
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_013 what that makes them good contact points is that they like make the wires stick like not stick but clip on so it does not have t so it does not like get loose or anything
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_015 what is important is that electricity flews ma flows through metal
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_016 s what i see is that a and b work and they are work they work really well together and a and b they work and that makes the light bulb light up like dynamite will y
myst_997690_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_017 what happens has to happen is you have to get a switch
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_001 how are you
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004 a conductor is something that will let a motor work
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_010 s a sponge does not have any iron in it so it will not let the motor work aluminum nails will because it has like it will let the motor run
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_002 we have been doing magnetism and seeing what could make a motor run
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_009 insulators are stuff that do not have any iron in them and that do not work
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_011 a sponge is an insulator a popsicle stick is a sponge is a pebble rock but and the black rock is a conductor
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_012 they do not insulators do not have any they will not let the motor work because they do not have any iron in them
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_015 the motor will not work cause the insulator shuts dow
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_013 when i clicked the sponge the motor did not work it just sat there and did not move
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_008 rocks aluminum nails metal stuff that have iron in them and just stuff like that
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_003 we if we take an aluminum nail it actually would make the motor work if you connect the two wires to it
myst_997690_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014 you have to touch them to make sure that they are metal and that they will work because if they are not metal then they will not let the motor work
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012 probably a washer will make it work but it sometimes will not
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_020 the flow is the m basically what it just is doing if the electricity is flowing or if it is not
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_028 see you later bye
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016 when i turned the switched switch on it picked up the washers but when when the switch is clo closed then when the switch is open then it does not pick up the washers
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_019 it is not really working because of how how the wires wrapped it is not really wrapped very good so i probably would not recommend if you bye bye
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_001 good how are you
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024 it has to be closed for it to attract it
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_027 they changed their battery power when their use too much and it it does not really help it a lot but yeah they mentioned the thing you just mentioned to me
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_023 it is that actually when it is when it is when it is closed there is a lot of electricity still flowing
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_018 it does not work it just stops
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_017 well it just kind of connects because of the flow of it probably
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004 well you have to wrap if you do not wrap it around really good then it will not work but if you wrap then if but if you wrap it e around over and over again then it will work
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009 because there is just a lot of work and if if it does it t the wire is not connected to it then it is not going to work because if it has no electricity in it
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006 it is about what the rivet can pick up
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015 i am sorry what
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007 you make it work because of the the rivet kind of has most of the energy
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003 well it just kind of has some wer wa well what we do is we have to make and it is really strong so that it will not get off so that is why they are there is so much magnet and these washers that you do not even know about it and then the wires and that is how that they are making the wires being connected and the the little washers to be connected to the rivet
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_025 it is picking it up
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005 the d cell is the bat well the d cell is the battery the washer is the th the things that the rivet picks up and the switch is to make it work the wires are to be connected and wrapped around the rivet and then the rivet and then and then the steel rivet is the one that makes it all happen
myst_997690_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_008 it means that there is magnetism in it and that there is a lot of stuff in it
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_033 so the positive goes to the negat
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_012 so the positive goes to the bottom and then the negative goes to the side of the light bulb and that makes that the d cell to light up the the light bulb
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_017 so the wires let us just say that the wires are the pathway and the battery is the resource which it already is but it is a source then the light bulb is the resource wha then after that they receive the power and make it go to the light bulb
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_009 it means that the light bulb what it has to do is a circuit it makes the electricity flow from the from the wires and then and then it goes through the wires and that makes the light bulb to turn over and makes it be a receiver cause it goes to the positive which is the d cell which is the source
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_001 good how are you
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_013 they have to be connected to the and the negative into the bottom into the side
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_011 what it can do is that it goes through the d cell and it goes positive to the negative
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_028 in the middle of the circuit
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_015 for it to be a circuit it has to be mo going through the wires more cause it looks disconnected and when it is disconnected it will not work
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_021 it shows you the and the and it is m helping the electricity bolt d cell work
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_016 but after that it will not do anything it will just stay there and yeah
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_010 what it means is that the it receives the battery and the power and electricity
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_004 the d cell helps some like helps the stuff hook up and makes helps it and helps it go up and the light bulb would be the receiver
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002 well now we have been working on s electricity and d cell batteries and making stuff light up it is like it is making to see if a d cell battery could go to to a wire to connect it to the light bulb to make the light bulb work
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_023 it is important so that it can flow to the positive to the negative cause that is the way that it flows and so that the light bulb can light up
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_024 it lights the light bulb up
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_003 it is a d cell battery a light bulb stand wires and a little stand for everything to go into
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_022 two of the wires have to be connected to the and the and then one of the wires is being connected to the side of the light bulb and the other one is at the bottom of the light bulb to make the light bulb work and flow
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_005 to have enough power in the light bulb i mean zero my gosh in the battery the d cell
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_006 battery is a battery is a d cell and it makes the power go through the wires and then that goes to the lights
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_027 what happens is that the first one is connected to the bottom which will not let it out but then the next one it only have one wire so that will not light it up but then this one will not light it up but then this one the last one the fourth one will light it up cause it is connected to the side and s and t and to the bottom
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_030 one goes to the side and one goes to the bottom
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_025 you can not have the electricity flowing if it is going cause if that happens then it will go positive to negative it will turn the whole thing around
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_018 electricity and it flows yeah and just flows and stuff
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_032 closed it is because there is nothing flowing it is not connected
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_008 the light bulb makes the circuits light up the wires go through into it and then that makes the power go into the light bulb and stuff like that
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_020 the battery helps that and it made it work
myst_997690_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_014 the positive is producing the light to the bottom of the light bulb if the light has power already in the light bulb but then when they put the power in there it is i think that it lights up more and then when you put it to the negative side it does not do much but it does help light it up
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 just hold on just one minute
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 this pick this po
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_017 that has a lot of magnet magnetic and magnetism in it and that the nail and then the magnet helps the nail attract something else so like a paper clip has iron in it so of course the magnet is going to attract to that but dell keeps on looking at me right now so that i can not really concentrate and so is but anyways the nail and that is all i have to say
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014 when the magnet is is on the nail it picks up the paper clip but then when you let go of the magnet it let goes
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 i think that when the magnets were under the table that there was enough there was enough force to get through the wood of the table and then it would go through and that makes it connect and there was enough force
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_022 if you rub the magnet against the ma the the the nail then it wi it will last like i do not know like a couple of second or minutes and then it it will still have enough enough iron then it will work
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_006 they were connecting because of that it was so powerful that it was attract it was not attracting to the other ones because it they were washers and washers do not connect to another one of washers so when the washers connect to the aluminu aluminum steel they still will not stick but when you stick em to the regular ones the doughnut hole ones then they will stick and that is that
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_015 what is up with that is with the the magnet is touching the nail th and the nail is attracting to the paper clip and that is it that means that it is a temporary magnet and that it does not stop looking at me right now but and then what happens is it does not have a lot of force in it
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_021 what we have to do with the magnet is just keep the magnet away and then the nail will connect with the paper clip because it rocks zero yes yes it does
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_020 what happened was the nail was co was never mind when the magnet was going onto the nail you could not you could not connect the paper clip when the magnet was away you had some iron and then what you could do with that was make the paper clip do stuff
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_018 the nail is acting like a temporary magnet
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_004 well when you put them together they would stick because they are permanent magnets and when that happened then you would know that it was a permanent magnet if it stuck together but if it did not you know that it was steel or aluminum or aluminum
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_009 well the force is making one magnet is making the force make have another force and then the force of that would make it go to the other one so that the force of the one on the top would be making the one follow the other one and making the force that ma the other one has a little bit of force but then the other one has much more force because it has lot of force
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_003 well when y the magnetism works it is it works because when the magnets are there then you can t put them together and then that is yes magnetism
myst_997690_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_002 we have been doing stuff with magnets and stuff like like magnetism and all that type of stuff
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_019 it only picks up three washers
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_010 there is a one hundred winds on the rivet and a one hundred winds would pick up fifteen washers because you are you are you are making the battery probably half losing probably a lot of energy that is it
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_015 the battery probably like the power
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_023 it picks up more washers
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_009 you have to make it strong so that it will be able to pick up the washers
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_014 the more wires you put in probably
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_032 it increases by two and then up to one
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_027 probably on a graph on a graph it would be good probably
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_003 they are very very strong
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_034 and i i like what they do here they make it up to go from zero
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_040 i went to ninety-five and then i thought it could not go it could not go higher than a one hundred cause then one hundred is kind of going up to fifteen but probably would not be there
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_033 it goes to fifteen still but it is going faster an
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_004 there is a rivet and washers and the rivet is picking up the washers
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_013 the battery has a lot of power probably and the switch does not have closed
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_022 keep adding more wi
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_026 there is more electricity flowing through
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_030 there is a lot of well it shows the wraps and what the wra what the the what the rivet picks up like how much it picks up and it did not go up to thirty it just went up to fifteen
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_012 forty-three so that means that there is forty-three washers they are just going through
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_031 more washers to pick up
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_017 it picks up more washers
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_036 that there is a lot of strength
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_029 on the side of the graph it represents how many washers were picked up
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_039 i found it and it probably be like near twenty not really near twenty but like one thousand, four hundred and fifteen around there
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_018 the winds there are
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_011 that there is a lot of winds
myst_997690_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_024 it d it lets it does not bring up a lot but it usually does pick up a lot
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_039 well it makes it light up more
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_002 good how are you
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_025 when you switch it it goes one direction but then when you s switch it like that it goes the other direction
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_013 one has and and one has and negative which but then they are they are pointing the same way so that is causing it to not work
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_014 it is dimming down because there is not a full flow of the electricity
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_011 they compare because the light bulbs are both lighting up
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_017 well it is going positive to and it is flowing electricity is flowing through the light bulb and the light bulb is still dimming because there is not there is not enough electricity flowing
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_024 when you switch the battery around it goes the other direction but when you switch it over like that everything goes in the same direction
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_038 they are lined up the same but they are just fl but the electricity is just flowing the different directions
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_042 it is two batteries and two switches
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_037 it switches directions
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_028 there is two li there is two light bulbs two batteries and they are flowing because the negative is not connected to the other and the positive is not connected to the other positive
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_030 well there is two light bulbs which there were two light bulbs before and the electricity was flowing the same way but the only different thing that it has is two batteries
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_005 a circuit is where it goes all the way through and has paper in it and stuff like that
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_019 well electricity is flowing from the battery to the light bulb
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_012 well there is t one light bulb that is lighting up and there is two light bulbs that are lighting up too because both of the elec the electricity is flowing through both of the wires which is making the light bulb to light up
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_007 it circles around the the battery and then the battery works
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_027 is flowing away from the positive
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_031 it works like it did before but just a little more power
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_022 it is flowing from negative to positive so that it shows me that there there is a flow but if there is not a flow then the light bulb will not light up
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_026 it always flows positive to negative
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_003 we have been doing pathways and electricity and stuff
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_008 the battery has to be positive to negati
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_018 well the blue dots keep going and going until they stop when you disconnect the wires
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_015 it didn it does compare because they are both lighting up but it does not compare because one is dim and one is fully lit up
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_040 it makes it have more power and light up more
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_032 i noticed that they were both flowing the same direction
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_041 it lights up more because of the there is more electricity
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_009 well there is a pathway in the wires the well it is a pathway where this where the electricity flows and then the circuits is like staying in the middle kind of because in this picture it shows how it is flowing
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_006 the energy is flowing through the wires which is making the light bulb light up
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_004 it goes through the wire and it flows positive to negative
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_033 that actually one d cell can be
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_029 it is important that the light bulbs both ligh
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_045 ite it represents two batteries and two switche
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_035 two batteries make the makes more electricity so that makes the the light bulbs light up more and one battery only makes it makes it dim so there is not a lot of li a lot of power in it but there is like a little power in it but not a lot
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_021 yes because it is flowing
myst_997690_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_044 i figured out that
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011 helps the light bulb light up
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_027 wires be connected to the and the negative to make it to make the motor work
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017 sorry can you repeat that again
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015 ever is the light bulb because of the motor then motor is connected by the wires and the wire is connected by the light bulb and when the base goes there it helps the generate generator to go t from the d cell
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_014 it connects and that makes it both light up and the motor work
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 it carries electricity positive to negative
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_035 the and the negative
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_039 h those are the wires connecting
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_036 a battery a battery that has a and negative
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_023 it is making everything go crazy
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_029 it is letting the wires touch the motor and helping it go on and on
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005 so we had a motor a d cell battery and a stand for the light bulb and then we had a string that got connected to the motor and then we had a switch and then we had a plate for everything to go on
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003 we have been trying to connect stuff to make like a switch work and make the light lit up
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_034 the light bulb is connecting to the wire zero i love and there is a pathway for letting it go through
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_020 it makes it work when you open it and then when you by it it is it shuts everything up well
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_024 what is happening is it is by so that is making the flag go through
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_012 well if you have a complete circuit it will help it light up but if you do not then it kind of will not but sometimes when you do like a complete circuit it will light up but sometimes if you have too much r too much stuff energy in it then it will not light up
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_032 it is probably why it did not work
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 it receives it and then ships it off to new orleans sorry
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_026 it is flowing and flowing and flowing and flowing and flowing and flowing through all of them
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_016 the light the motor is running because the d cell is n putting the electricity to go to the motor to make it work
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_007 oop the d cell battery connects to the light bulb to make it light up
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008 the d cell makes it light up because of the wires and then the motor
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019 m can you repeat this
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_009 a d cell does with the circuit is like it connects to the wires and then the wires connects to the motor and the motor connects to the light bulb and then to the switch
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_033 well see well it is just a pathway and then the light goes through
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_004 so the switch is what contains the
myst_997690_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_041 well i do not really know what that is
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_019 there was enough spacers that it took that the force could not stay together and it they would not stick so
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_016 the two magnets have the same force so that is how they connected together and b is a little tilted up since the the force is making the force is making it pull down together so it sticks together and there is enough force to get through each other to stick
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_027 took nineteen washers in a nineteen washers in b and then group d took nineteen washers and then in group c five
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006 in the cup that connected to the other magnet that connected to the magnet and then we put the disk in between and then the washers we used to put in b in a cup so that the b cup would go and we would see how many disk it took took to make it slip off
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_026 a b and d got nineteen washers and that was enough and the other pictures that you showed me to disconnect it and they did not have enough force
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011 put this when you put the spacers between the magnets it sh shows if it is p if the force is powerful enough to make it hold and then when you put the magnet in it is it is exactly like that since all those two magnets are connected to toge together
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_024 to just follow the rules and look out what they are doing and that is what they kind of do i guess
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008 they connected to each other so when there was too many they d dis they disconnected from each other and then they on th on b there was too many so there is twenty and then once that was there then that shows how many magnets is the what the magnetism one
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_007 there was too many washers ye there was nineteen washers and then what happened was there was too many so the mag the magnets took they were not connected like the they connected since there were since nineteen was the limit i mean twenty was the limit for it to go up
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_014 what is happening is that the magnets have enough force to get through one spacer so it does not move cup b and it does not move cup a
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_017 it makes cup b tilt a little bit and then and what happens is when you take the spacers out what will happen is it will go down like this
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_003 we have been dealing with magnets and magnetism
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005 well the silver doughnut things are do not have any magnets in them and then the glasses go under the scales and then s jordan and then the gold stuff are the like like the disk that we put in between the s the stand and then the doughnut magnet
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_015 it does not ha it does not have enough force to get through the spacers that they that i put under and then it made it kind of di disconnec disconnect from each other and then went to cup cup b and the cup b tilted a little bit
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004 we had like a doughnut magnet and then like a stand with the magnet connected to it and we had cups a and b on the stand thingy and when we put the magnets on connected to the other one b went up because a was connected to the other magnet which was under a cup
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_020 s five spacers needed thirty-three washers just because there was enough
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_021 they are going down and down and down and down so that is what is happening
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_013 it shows if there is enough force to go through the spacers but if there is not then then it will show and it will all connect and then the spacers will fall down
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_023 to set up our experiment is wait like scales and then two plastic cups then we need washers two doughnut holes one stick with washers on it and that is what we need
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_025 what they put into the cup was w washers in nineteen washers in a b yeah and d and then that took enough force to disconnect them
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_018 cup a ha does not have enough force to stick to the other doughnut hole but then that is just how it works
myst_997690_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_028 spacers and then that is what happened
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_008 when it is on the magnet it like spins to the other way and when it is off the magnet it goes to the right side
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_002 we have been learning about magnets
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_004 putting a paper clip around a box and then if it stick if it sticks to the box that means there is the magnet
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_006 well it was kind of hard trying to find where the magnet was
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_007 it is like moving around
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_024 the north kept moving to the magnet
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_014 kept like sticking once it once we got closer it kept pulling itself all the way to the magnet
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_025 well when i spin it around it keeps like the north keeps spinning around toward the middle of where i spun it so that means the magnet is right in the middle of where i spun it
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_021 it has metal and iron in it so that makes it stick to the magnet
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_012 it is sticking to the box
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_003 i do not know
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_022 it is metal and iron and if you rub a magnet to the a paper clip another paper clip sticks to it
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_017 stuck to the box and then it did not fall off so we knew there was a magnet there
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_010 the paper clips started to spin around once it got closer to the magnet
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_020 most of the iron filings are lined up and some of them are like all messed up
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_018 it started a attracting all the to the magnet
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_011 the north and south pole are connecting
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_028 nor the north and south attract and north and north a or south and south repel
myst_997495_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_027 this is made from iron so it makes it stick to metal
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_024 the parallel circuit is when one light bulb burns out none of the others do
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_033 the the wire is connected to the d cell which goes to the which goes to the light bulb then it connects to another light bulb and goes back to the other light bulb and then it goes back to the d cell
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_007 the power is coming from the battery and going to the light bulbs
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_020 we are learning about electromagnets
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_029 i do not know
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_023 there is a series circuit and a parallel circuit the parallel circuit is on the right and the series is on the left
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_036 the d cell is connected to a wire which goes to the light bulb and then another wire which goes to the next light bulb and then back to the d cell
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_034 if one bulb burns out then the and it the other ones will not burn out
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_032 the electricity only travels one way in the series circuit in the parallel circuit it splits up and goes two ways
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_038 i do not know
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_014 i do not understand
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_004 two light bulbs a battery
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_017 they all go out
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_030 it only goes one way in the series circuit
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_028 the electricity only goes one way through the wire
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_039 then all of them go out
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_037 the light bulbs burn brighter
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_031 electricity in parallel circuit travels both ways and elec electricity in the series circuit travels only one way
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_035 i do not know
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_009 if i click on it one turns on and one turns off
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_015 if there is a wire connecting to both of them the wire goes out too and they both go they both burn
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_010 the light bulbs are like in one wire stick together and in the other one there is a wire connected to the battery
myst_997495_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_026 in a parallel circuit the it goes both ways and in a series circuit the electricity only travels one way
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_010 the circuit kinds of kind of sounds like circle so it goes in a circle
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008 in the circuit the energy is traveling round and round
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 a battery is making electricity go through the wire which powers the motor and then it comes back from the other to the from the other wire then goes to the battery again
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002 we have been learning about batteries
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017 the motor starts moving
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015 when the switch that is off the little block hits the metal by the wire then it starts spinning around
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_009 battery is putting the well the battery is putting having wires which go to the engine well the motor and then the motor starts spinning around
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_007 they bring the energy f from the battery to the motor which powers the motor
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_006 they make electricity travel through em
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003 those are wires that connect to the battery to move the engine
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005 well the battery goes through the well the battery goes through the wire which is energy that connects to the engine which starts the motor
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 the motor starts moving and because electricity travels through metal and that makes it start to move
myst_997495_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_012 it keeps turning around because circuit kind of sounds like circle so it goes in a circle
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 the magnet is putting a lot of force in the nail so that picks up the paperclip
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_015 the paperclip does not wa do it when the the does not pick up the well the nail does not pick up the paperclip when the magnet is not on and when the magnet is on the paperclip gets picked up by the nail
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_017 it is hanging from the pa it the paperclip is hang hanging from the nail
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_013 they have so much force so they just they stick together because the paperclip is made of steel and iron
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_018 the magnet force is really strong so it the puts some force in the nail which makes it pick up the paperclip
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_003 we have been a
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 paperclip is made of steel so it sticks to the magnet which the magnet has magnet has so much force it sticks to the paper to the paperclip
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_002 we have been studying water and magnets
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 and same sides attract
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014 the magnet is sticking to the nail and the paperclip is sticking to the nail and
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_011 they do not stick together they try to get away from each other
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_019 a blue shield around it keeps the from the magnet puts keeps the shield around the nail which keeps the paperclip up
myst_997495_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_009 they are repelling and then when they move around the they repel and they have so much force that they move around together
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_012 well the wires are parallel so they would go each w the electricity would flow each way and then goes back in the d cell again
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015 going from the bottom of the d cell to the top
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003 we have been lighting light bulbs and powering motors
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_010 in the parallel circuit the light bulbs are are brighter
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_009 when a light bulb burns out on a parallel circuit then the other light bulb stays
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018 this shows a parallel circuit
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_007 parallel circuit when light one light bulb burns out the other one keeps on
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_013 there are two wi ways
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_004 the d cell is powering the wires through the the d cell is powering electricity through the wires which powers the light bulbs and then comes back to the d cell and then goes to the other wires and powers that light bulb
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_005 the electricity is flowing out of the bottom of the d cell and going to the lights then when it once it flows through the lights it comes out of the light and goes to the d cell and it keeps doing that
myst_997495_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011 on the series circuit it is just a one way wire and then on the parallel circuit the electricity goes both ways
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_022 the salt will get dissolved and
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_011 they are getting separated so it is not a mixture anymore
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_013 it is important because it shows that it is it got separated and is not a solution
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_005 this is a
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_025 yes you can get it out by evaporating the water
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_003 it is a mixture of different things
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_020 the salt gets dissolved to make the water higher
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_002 we learn learned about mixtures and
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_010 they are filtering it out so that it is not a mixture any
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_006 the marbles are round
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_004 they are all
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_014 they do not they are separated
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_015 it is filtering out the sand
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_009 they are in groups and of what they are
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_008 they are getting separated so it is not a mix
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_012 it is filtering out the marble
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_027 mixtures can be separated and solutions can not
myst_014024_2013-12-12_12-49-11_MX_1.1_007 you are separating them into different piles of what they
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_010 one has twenty grams of solute the other has ten grams of
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_009 one has ten grams of solute the other has twenty
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_013 because one has twenty grams the other has ten
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_015 the grape one gets darker and darker which means that it is getting more concentrated and more concentrated
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_006 the feather weighs two grams the rock weighs ninety
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_017 one is the most concentrated and two is the least
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_007 the rock is a lot heavier than the
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_020 one is most concentrated two is least concentrated
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_019 the most is one the lest is three
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_008 we have been weighing stuff in science
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_012 my prediction was correct the twenty gram solute weighed
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_002 we are working on mixtures and solutions
myst_014024_2014-01-28_12-30-32_MX_2.2_011 the one with twenty grams will weigh more
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_016 it is not as sweet and flavorful
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_002 mixtures and solutions
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_020 add more water
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_003 a solution is something that can not be separated how you make it is you mix something together
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_009 the more color it has or how or how much more powder it has
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_006 you can see by how how the different the color
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_010 the more powder it had
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_014 it would taste more flavorful
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_015 it would taste less concentrated or less flavorful
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_019 you can add more water so it would be more spread out
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_008 the one on the left has more powder the one on the right has less powder
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_013 it is less concentrated
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_017 by adding more water
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_018 you can do different amounts of water so it would have less in it
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_011 the darker or lighter the color is
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_007 the one on the left has more solute and it is darker
myst_014024_2014-01-09_12-45-55_MX_2.1_012 the darker ones are more concentrated
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_041 it is a mixture
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_032 it is a mixture
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_003 trying to prove the point that when you add something together it changes it is properties
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_009 it is a thing that is that is not getting dissolved
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_023 it is fifty fifty fifteen and it shows that the salt keeps it is own or keeps it is own weight
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_043 they are perfect squares the so the salt did not contain it is same properties
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_040 it worked that you can separate a solution but but yeah
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_007 the salt got mixed in and the and dissolved and the sand did not
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_011 because they they stay together or and they can not be separated
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_018 it means that when you add them together it adds more weight
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_039 it is evaporating
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_008 it dissolved to show that it is a solution
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_038 it is evaporating into the air and now the salt is back again
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_026 you are separating out the flour by putting it in the filter and you are separating them
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_013 it is the solvent and the salt is going to dissolve into it
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_016 when you add it together it adds the grams of the salt
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_045 it requires time you need time to evaporate stuff
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_022 the salt is fifteen grams and the water is fifty grams so when you add them together it is sixty-five grams
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_019 it is bigger
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_002 we have been learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_020 the mass is getting bigger and heavy
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_004 you are mixing sand and water together to make a sand and water solution
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_012 the salt is a solute and it gets dissolved
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_030 it is a solution
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_036 and in salt and water you can evaporate the salt out
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_015 it is all mixed together and heavier than each separate
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_033 the the citric acid dissolved and into the water and it could not be separated with this filter
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_037 the salt dissolved and then you evaporated it so then it it it was back to the the salt again
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_017 it is adding more weight
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_025 you can either separate it by evaporating it like salt and water or use something different
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_042 only salt to show that it worked to separate it out
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_046 the you you can not separate a a solute from a solution and you can separate salt and water by evaporation
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_029 the salt dissolved into the water so it could not be separated with that kind of filter
myst_014024_2013-12-19_12-46-40_MX_1.2_031 a mixture because the cause the sand is separated and if it had stayed in the water it would have been a solution
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_002 mixtures and solutions
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_014 how heavy it is
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_027 by adding more solute
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_017 the one on the left has more powder in it and is therefore less or more
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_028 if you add more solvent
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_019 that they are more dense
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_006 you add things together and if if you can not separate them it is a solution
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_003 you add a lot of things together and if if you can not separate it it is a
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_012 the one on the left has more powder so it is more
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_024 it would not taste as flavorful
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_013 the one on the left has more powder therefore it is more
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_005 mixtures and solutions
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_018 the darker ones are more dense and the lighter ones are less dense
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_022 the darker one has more spoonfuls of the drink mix and the other one has less and is less colorful
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_007 the first one has more powder in it and therefore it is more dense
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_021 cause it has less powder in it
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_026 the amount of water
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_023 more it would have more flavor
myst_014024_2014-01-30_12-43-21_MX_2.1_016 how dark or light it is or how dense or how concentrated it is
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_020 because sand can not go through the filter and it worked
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_005 the rocks are getting filtered out of the water because of the screen
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_015 it worked because it is magnetic paper clips are magnetic
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_021 it worked because all the water evaporated and the salt was back then
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_019 it worked because it does it does not it can not got through
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_016 cause paper because paper clips are magnetic
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_018 because it would work more efficiently than anything else
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_014 because they have different properties they may not they may be magnetic and they might not
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_007 okay what do you want to talk about then
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_003 they can be they they what
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_002 we have been talking about mixtures and solutions
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_012 to separate the rock
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_024 that you can separate all everything in different ways
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_013 because that thing is magnetic so it would stick to the magnet
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_022 it means that it that is the way it has to be separated and no other way would work
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_017 it separated out the rocks because the the size of the the screen fits it
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_004 mixtures by a screen magnetism and density
myst_014024_2013-12-17_12-31-24_MX_1.3_023 it is a solution
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_037 they get a lot both light bulbs get a lot brighter because it seems as each light bulb has their own battery so they each get power the same
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_015 well it starts in the negative side of the battery the electricity goes out goes into the light bulb and then it goes out a out of that light bulb and into the other one and comes back to the positive
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_018 well the blue dots sort of show electricity i guess
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_004 well a circuit is a thing that the electricity will sorta go through i guess and it goes through and yeah and electricity go goes through and it makes different like it can make different things light up for in a light bulb or like a motor spin
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_025 the and the electricity flows towards the positive side of the battery
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_033 well it definitely does light up the light bulb a lot more
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_026 it reverses the direction of the way that the electricity flows
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_007 the electricity has to fl flow through all the wires and get through all the different switches and stuff in order to get into the light bulb and then it goes into the light bulb and back out of the other into the of the that it goes from the po negative side up into the battery and back out and then repeats
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_024 well the electricity f flows from the from the negative side
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_002 pretty good how are you
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_012 well when you look at them one of them has two light bulbs and they are both and they both getting a they are both getting but not a the one of them is getting more power than the other one and that is the one that the wire is connected to the positive side of the battery because yeah
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_020 well the elec electricity flows through it just like all it goes flows all the way through the light bulb just like it just like it will flow all the way through the battery
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_014 well when they are dimmer it means like there is not as much light in it and what they need what they are trying to do is well it they are using the same amount of electricity that they had to power one but now they need they need more electricity so if they wanted to make them both light up brighter then they could try using like two batteries
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_036 they lit up they w they lit up a lot brighter
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_041 marnie i have already told you that
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_019 well of course the electricity has to t flow from the negative side of the battery into the positive side of the battery
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_008 well without one of them the li it would be open circuit or i guess it could be a closed circuit but it would not do anything
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_029 well flows the way it is like a pathway that the electricity flows through
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_030 it goes faster
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_032 well it makes the light bulb light up a lot more
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_021 well the electricity flows through both battery i mean through both light bulbs
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_028 well it it it reverses the direction which means it still comes out of the it still goes into the and out from the negative but the electricity it just flows in the opposite direction
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_040 well one of them has a when it they are both well re in right now the and poti positive are connected and when that happens then it can not then the circuit cannot be complete the and the negative side need to be connected in the middle
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_011 well this would have to share the electricity so one of them so they both get the same amount of power so they can both get light up
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_039 you have to make sure that the and the positive side are touching and if you have the and the negative side then it would not work
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_003 well we have been working on we have been working on circuits and trying to light two light bulbs yep
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_045 it is a schematic
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_023 well the electricity flows out of the and back into the light bulb and back out and into the positive
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_035 it flows a lot faster
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_013 well one of them is since they are using the same about amount of electricity well sa that they would have done b to power one light bulb since they are powering two now the the light bulb gets dimmer because it is not as much electricity going going to light to light them up a bit more
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_034 there is more energy or electricity which means it flows faster
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_016 the electricity is traveling from the negative side of the battery into the positive side of the battery and through both of the light bulbs
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_005 well electricity is just electricity l gets taken from the positive so to the battery i mean negative side of the battery and that it is the produ it is the producer and then it sends the electricity to the receiver
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_017 the blue dots are the electricity
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_038 well when they are two batteries they bo they light up a lot brighter when there is only one they do not light up as much
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_006 all the wires connected one wire is connected to the positive side and the other connected to the negative side and it everyone is connected correctly and it makes the light bulb light up
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_022 well the it is going from the negative side of the battery back into the positive side
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_031 the electricity is flowing faster than it than it usually does because there are two batteries and the light bulb is li bri lighting up a lot more
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_044 they get fa the electricity gets faster
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_027 well it works both ways it just reverses the direction the electricity flows
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_009 well the electricity goes sort of on a pathway from the negative side of the battery into the light bulb and back out of the positive side
myst_997685_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_010 well one of them is powering two batteries i mean two light bulbs
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_027 when you stop rubbing it th th there is a little bit of magnet magnetic force in the ma in the nail which makes it become a temporary magnet ta
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 i think the force of the magnet i am pretty sure that it is the force just because i guess
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_029 so when the n when you get the magnet in some of the magnet some of the magnet goes right through the nail goes through the nail and make which makes it become a temporary temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_025 when you rub the nail to the magnet then it it creates the the fields the fields the magnet fields from the permanent magnet will go all the way it will go all the way through the nail and that will make it able to to become a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_017 well we have tested this and actually you do not need a magnet on it all the time in order for the paper clip to stick to the nail because the nail is acting as a temporary magnet and
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 it is because the one the two at the bottom are touching from positive to and then the back of the one is sticking up to the negative of one of them and they are like they are repelling from each other because one of them has a and one of them has a and and positive do not go together they will not stick if and positive are together
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_010 it is the force of the magnet and that is what makes it m well someone has to sort of be moving the top one and it is the force of the magnet so yeah
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_030 talking good bye thank you for helping me learn and listen and thank you for listening to me and thank you for letting me listen to you
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_023 the nail is acting as a temporary magnet the magnet made the magnet field went all the way through the nail and it stayed there for a little while so it was able to pick up the paper clip but the nail is not a magnet the doughnut the magnet is a is a permanent magnet and the other one is a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 well i sort of do not agree with what this is doing
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_020 what it means is the magnet the magnet is going all the way through the nail except for the tip and when we tested it actually it would go all the way to the tip and it would be able to touch you could just take a plain nail and pick it up but in this picture on the blue fields is the it is it is it is kind of turning into a magnet i guess a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_021 well if you ask me i think that what it is trying to show you is the nail is acting as a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_018 the nail actually is acting as a temporary magnet a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_009 well sort of depending on depending on how strong the magnet is you can put it the magnet force is stronger depending on how big it is and in this picture here at the table these the magnet on the top is using its force its force to connect to the other magnet on the bottom
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_026 the nail is acting as a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_013 well the force the force the force in in the the force the force the force that is the force from the magnet the force through the mag the force of the magnet is trying to go through the paper but since the paper is so thick or the thing is so thick that it will not be able to go through so that sort of it
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_011 well the magnet is very the magnet is very what it is called the magnet is very strong and the force is going right through the table and to the other magnet
myst_997685_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_019 i think it is trying to show you that the nail is acting as a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_017 well behind each brad the two wires are connected
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_014 well metal well electricity can run through metal in this case it is metal and so it just the electricity goes through the brad and yeah
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_010 well there has to be a wire running from each end of the brad
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_011 the green wire is a little mini wire and and they are both connected to the brads and if if i put my two other ends of the wires to a and b it will make the light bulb light up
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_015 well you have to attach the both wires to the both wires from the d cell from and the other one from the light bulb to to two different brads on the s on the mystery board and whichever one makes the light bulb light up then it is then it is the right one
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_006 well if there was no wire behind the board then the light bulb or the motor would never light up
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_005 in the back of them there is a mystery wire in em and the mystery wire what they are trying to do is they are you have to put your two wires to figure out which one the whe where the wire was connected and in this case it is the wire is connected through a and d so you will keep trying until your wire gets put on a and d and then whatever you are trying to run lights up in this case a light bulb or a motor will run
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_012 well the brads they they are metal so they can they can make the w the electricity go through itself and then into the wire and then out to make a complete circuit
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_007 well the mystery board makes kids like me try to connect the wires to figure out which wire will connect to the brads or pape fa paper fasteners to find out which which two brads were the wires connected to
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_008 well what you do is you take the two ends of the of the wires and what happens is you try to connect them to the brads on the mystery board and whichever one that they whichever two brads will connect to each other then the wire will make the light bulb light up then the wire is behind it and when the wire is behind it then the light bulb will light up and you know that the wire is behind there
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_016 well you know that a space y well you know that space can not could not make the wires go so you know that there has to be a wire behind the circuit board connecting the two brads
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_018 it tells me that behind a and b brads are connected to a small wire that completes the circuit
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_001 very well i am having so much fun how about you
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_003 well they are like little boards and they have brads and they have a wire through there but you do not know where the wire is so you have to try to find out where it is
myst_997685_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_013 well they are easy to put your wire to and they are metal
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_022 they are opposite opposite like s and n well not opposite but s and n attract and n and n attract i mean n and n repel
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_015 well sometimes they sometimes they can come together and they stick but sometimes they will not let you even touch them together or it is really hard to and sometimes they well not stick to each other but you are able to touch
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_017 some of them will stick together and some of them will not
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_018 i think that it has to i think that it has to do with which side it is on but i am not really sure
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_005 yes marnie you did repeat yourself and you did a very good job
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_014 but first i have a question and my question is does it have will will she answer it does it have to have iron can it have iron in it for it to be able to stick to the magnet or does it have to be all iron
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_010 well we were thinking that everything that is iron will attract to the magnet and like things that are aluminum and stuff will not attract to the magnet because they actually i am not sure
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_020 s and n will repel each other and i mean s and n will attract to each other and n and n or s and s will not will repel each other
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_004 marnie i got it to work
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_023 i definitely think we should go over this again because i did not completely really get to say all that i wanted to say
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_012 well magnet sticks to iron and steel i do not exactly know why that is but it is pretty cool because if there is something that is magnetic on a table then you wave over a magnet it just like flies up and connects to the magnet
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_002 hi marnie my name is stella i mean sorry my name is jordan my name is jordan and i am ten years old what what is your name
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_009 we have been learning about magnetism and electricity we have been working on magnetism and not electricity yet so i am not really know much about electricity we have been working on magnetism by we have been testing what things can stick to magnets and wh and that is kind of all
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_008 i have been ready for a long time
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_021 well i think it has to do with which side of the magnet you are using like s and n attract but n and n do not or s and s do not
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_019 well i can also see i can also see that they look a bit different color he and i wonder if it has to do with what is in the magnet
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_016 well one is not able to stick to each other and they are trying to push it but the other one is sticking together the top one is sticking together and the bottom one is not sticking together
myst_997685_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_013 there it only sticks to the steel nail because the steel nail is steel and the aluminum nail is aluminum and magnets do not stick to aluminum
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_025 well that means it will never be a magnet forever and they will not never be a it will be never be a magnet forever so yeah
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012 well you need to think well you need to think about every single part if there is no one part then the circuit does not work
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016 well it is it is just like a junkyard and there is like thing and it picks up all the metal then when y moves it away and then it drops it so that is what it that is exactly what this is acting as and it is picking up the washers when it is closed and then if you want to drop them then you open the circuit
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_022 then the washers go back up onto the rivet
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_031 well that y it just needs to be wrapped around something made of iron to be a temporary magnet you could wrap it around something like let us say you made a plastic nothing will happen
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_030 the rivet or core has been made from iron to be a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003 we have been working on making electromagnets
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_027 well the electricity s is flowing through the wires that is on the rivet which makes the rivet become a temporary magnet and then picks up all the washers almost all of them like some of the washers
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007 it is called a steel rivet
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_020 the electricity is being like open like not a full circuit not a complete circuit and then closed which is a complete circuit
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009 well there are washers down there and it sort of and it picks up the washers because it acts like a magnet because of the electricity
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010 well it it is just like a regular circuit except there is a new there is a new receiver and that is the electromagnet or the rivet
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_028 well because i can see the electricity flowing through the wires and i know that the wire is wrapped around the rivet and i also know that it it drains their battery power very fast and so you need the electricity flows really fast and you need and the second that the the that you open the switch then it goes down
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_011 that the electricity is flowing
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_026 well without the electricity the electromagnet would just be a plain rivet but you need the electricity f to go into the rivet and pick up those washers
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_021 when the switch is closed then the washers go up onto the rivet
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_008 so so the wire can th flow through it and make it an electromagnet
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_023 the washers they are just pieces of like steel and what they are doing is they are connecting to the w electromagnet and then getting like picked up
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015 the washers come up and like connect to the rivet
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_018 well a it just it whatever the electromagic had picked up it drops
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024 well the switch needs to the switch is a the switch blockses the electricity from flowing through when it is open and when it is closed it goes the electricity can flow through making the receiver in which in this case is the electromagnet work
myst_997685_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014 well you need to wrap it around the the rivet very very like precise
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_001 very good how are you
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_016 do not you mean a b and d
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_010 having spacers between the magnet weakens the force you know of the magnets
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009 well the the le the more washers there the more spacers there are the less washers it takes to break the force and the less spacers there are the more washers it takes
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008 well the spacers weaken the force of magnetism and in this picture there is only one washer in there because the force is not very strong
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004 the force is stronger
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_020 well group c did some diff some things differently so they got a way different result the group a and b and d got nineteen washers with zero spacers and group c only got s five washers and zero spacers which is a big difference from what like what what groups a b and d had
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_002 we have been working on well there is like sort of a scale and there is a magnet on the bottom and a magnet on the top and we were seeing and then we put like little spacer chips in front of them b inside like between them and then we were seeing like how many washers it would take to break the force of magnetis
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_018 a b and d got the same amount of data because they did the same procedures but group c did not
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_017 well i observed that well they group a b and d they stacked em and they stacked them in a nice neat row but group c kind of did their work sloppy and dropped it in
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005 the more numbers there are the the more number of washers there are means the stronger the force of magnetism is but the less number of washers that means the force is not very strong
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006 well we have something like that and we put washers into cup a
myst_997685_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_015 well group a they set it in and they did it group a b and d they set it in a like a line and so they got more they got more success and group c they dropped it in and did not do it very neatly then they got a lot less success
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_022 well you can make metal into a temporary magnet
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_013 insulators do not let electricity th thril flow through them and conductors do
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_021 they are all metal
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_015 i was talking
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_020 well metal is conductors and the m metal make electricity work and metal can be magnetized
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_012 they they bl they block electricity from flowing through and con conductors do not
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_009 insulators are things that are not made out of metal and they block electricity from coming through
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_016 the circuit is closed when you add an insulator i mean open when you add a insulator
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014 well only metal ones work only
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_026 they all have to be steel metal
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004 when i click things like the sponge and the things that are not made out of metal they the motor will not run and things that are made out of metal the motor will run
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_019 well a circuit would not com be complete circuit it would be an open it would be a closed circuit if an insulator was in it an insulator blocks electricity from throwing flowing through it unlike the com ca conductors that let the electricity flow right through them
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_003 in this picture they are showing a bunch of different items like nails and straws and sponges and paper fasteners and wire and rocks and stuff and w and some of them are insulators and some of them are conductors
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_007 is not a washer a conductor too
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_025 is it it has to be like steel
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_005 well if you add a conductor to a circuit then it will go and an insul the electricity will be able to throw th flow through it but an insulator is something that blocks electricity from flo throwing th through
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_018 the motor does not spin
myst_997685_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_002 we have been working with conductors and what i do not know we are we have been working with conductors and yeah just just conductors
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_022 the symbols the line with the longer line the short line and the long line represents the battery and the circle with the little loop in the middle is the light bulb
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003 we have been working on circuits
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008 wires carry the electricity from the from the po from the negative end of the d cell back to the positive
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019 each of those are symbols and the two lines are th is is the battery and the circle with the little loop inside of it is the light bulb and so it is just a simpler it is just a simplified version it is a simplified version of a of a circuit
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_021 i do not know marnie
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_010 a receiver has something that a receiver is the thing that receives the electricity
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_024 the m is for the motor
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002 very well how are you
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_014 well the electricity goes from the po a side of the battery up into the motor to make the motor go and then come out of the motor and back into the positive side of the battery
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005 the battery is the source and the source gives the electricity to to to send the electricity down to whatever it is supposed to do
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_009 well a motor is whe a motor could be the receiver it could be the motor could be a receiver it is the receiver
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 everything has to be every wire has to be connected
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_007 the wires the wires make the circuit the wires make the circuit possible without the wires then it would not be like a circuit
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_006 wire ca wires carry the wires carry the electricity from the battery from the d cell battery to the to the well in this ca in this case the light bulb or the motor
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011 it it it it it it just runs and it m makes the little tip of the top move and there is a piece of tape on it and so it you can see it almost like a flag
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 the switch it is almost like a light switch when you turn it on then then it runs but when you turn it off then it will not run and then and this in this picture it is off because the switch is open and the electricity will flow through the switch but in this case it can not because it is open it is an open circuit
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_020 well it is just a simplified version of a circuit and it just they have different symbols to make different different just different symbols so it does not you do not have to draw a battery and everything else
myst_997685_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015 marnie i did not say anything about a closed circuit
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_009 s salt water has no affect and it acts like plain water
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_003 the shape of the drop of water is circle on the bottom and it comes to a tip and goes right back down to the circle
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_007 when we build a water dome you keep building the surface tension until it just can not last any longer
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_004 surface tension is happening
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_012 the dome not to build as high
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_011 with plain water my penny held forty-three and with soapy water my penny held about thirty-four
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_006 surface tension is the property that keeps water together and not in a thin line
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_015 marnie i cannot understand you
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_002 we have been experimenting with water
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_016 well i thought the salt water would hold more but i realized the salt water just hold held the same
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_008 when you add salt water nothing happens and when you add soapy water the surface tension decreases making the dome smaller
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_013 the water had a dome shape and the on the plain water and the soapy water was a little flatter
myst_990502_2010-28-01_00-00-00_WA_1.2_010 we used droppers to put soapy salt and plain water on pennies and see which had or which one or substance we could put the most drops with
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_011 the water is basically doing the same thing it did on the left image it is evaporating
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_002 well we have been experimenting with ice and seeing and observing the properties of ice
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_024 putting a cap on is basically sealing in the humidity and when you seal in the humidity you basically do not have evaporation so it is that is basically what it is marnie i am sorry about the beep it is just the bell ringing
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_015 hi marnie i am doing great
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_019 you can slow down evaporation by putting a cap on a cup with water which basically is on the left figure so that is slowing down evaporation
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_004 the water ha is evaporating so it is basically getting smaller and it ceases to nothing
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_013 i can not find so it will just be a minute so i do not think my volume is off but it looks fine
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_010 when water dries out it is evaporating so what basically happens is the sunlight is basically heating up the water causing it to turn into vapor and the vapor to rise and that is basically what happens
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_022 when you put the lid on one cup and not the other cup you are basically holding in the evaporation so it is the water is not going anywhere so that is basically what happens
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_012 water when it evaporates it it rises and when it turns into gas it needs to be heated so that is basically what happens
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_003 it means to solidify i think
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_018 the uncovered wet paper towel
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_023 the wet paper towel stayed wet because the plastic lid is sealing in the humidity
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_014 it turns out my microphone was not in the proper position so that is why you could not hear me but i could hear you
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_017 i observed as you go forward the water in the cup without the lid is
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_021 the set up on the left well it is heavier because there is still water in the cup so that is basically how it is different
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_009 the water on the surface is evaporating over time
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_006 when the water dries out it basically evaporates and that means it is heated so it basically rises into the sky basically
myst_990502_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_005 you know there is water on the table because they are up is water see the drop or the drop er the huge mass coming up so that is basically w how you know there is water
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_006 you can put water on different surfaces and water droplets can be big and they can be small they usually can grow up to approximately one half of a centimeter high
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_013 the paper towel has absorbed the water
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_021 water comes in three different forms water vapor w w just plain water and ice
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_026 i have to go marnie bye
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_012 the water just completely absorbed into the paper towel or the paper towel completely absorbed the water and it was just a tiny little mark and when you put water all around the paper towel you could see the wrinkles
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_020 the water or the paper towel has absorbed the water
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_014 the paper towel has absorbed the water leaving a tiny mark
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_011 the water is making beads on the aluminum foil
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_009 the water on the foil left a tiny or it was just a trail and it did not absorb but it kinda stuck and you could not drag it along
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_008 i noticed that it on wax paper you could drag it on aluminum and every or it had or it did different or different things on every paper
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_010 the w water on the aluminum foil is building up on one bubble another or bead another bead is a little smaller and then there is a really tiny bead
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_016 the smaller droplets came together to make a bigger droplet
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_023 the soapy water decreases the surface tension when the salt water does not affect the surface tension
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_015 the water drops when they get by to each other they just put themselves together and they grouped
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_007 i have found that water does not sink int or the paper or wax paper does not absorb water aluminum foil does not plain white paper absorb or leaves a mark and paper towels just totally absorb
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_022 the soapy water affects how high the water can rise when the salt water just acts like normal water
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_019 that when it is not absorbed the water droplets can be visible but when it is not absorbed water or when it is absorbed water droplets
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_002 i am doing good thank you for asking
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_003 we have been studying water and its properties
myst_990502_2010-27-01_00-00-00_WA_1.1_025 yes droplets of water are coming out
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_028 the water has to evaporate out of the cup but with the lid it defies evaporation
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_016 i think it means that the water is really cold
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_007 well since the green and the air are the same temperature it is not doing anything because it is the same temperature but the blue cup since it is colder than room temperature water vapor is on the cup and it is basically condensation
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_012 the water on the surface is evaporating
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_018 on the blue cup i noticed that there is there is ice and it is that means it is cold so that therefore condensation will happen
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_008 when you put the ice in the are there is condensation on the surface because the water is getting colder
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_029 it is really cool cause it just amazes me
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_025 we observed that the condensation was in the inside with our actual condensation chambers
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_003 when condensation well condensation is basically when water droplets grouped together er water vapor in the air group together to make water droplets on colder surfaces
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_011 water ice well water and ice evaporate so that is basically what evaporates when you say evaporate a little different
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_021 the condensation on er is on the top of the cup so or it evaporated it is kind of hard to tell
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_017 the state of water after condensation is basically just a bunch of droplets and after the droplets are affected by gravity they become a small puddle
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_026 the water comes from the actual water on the inside of the cup because it evaporates but then it condensates inside the condensation chamber
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_002 we have been able er we have been experimenting how water goes through different materials such as rocks or gravel and soil
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_022 i think the drop er the water on the lid are water droplets so that basically is
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_006 we have er since the blue water is cold it is attracting more water vapor to the surface of the cup but the since the green water is room temperature it is not attracting any water vapor to it is surface
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_027 since there is a lid on the condensation chamber there is er the water is basically trapped inside so it does not get out of that condensation chamber unless there is holes in the lid which there is not
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_019 the water on the side of the blue cup is basically in droplet form and the droplets kinda have a flat top or like they look like a plateau
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_010 if the water in the cup is colder than the the surrounding air condensation goes on cup because the water molecules need air group together on the surface of the cup because it is cold and they form condensation droplets
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_004 well actually the air has water vapor in it now we can not see it we can not really well it is basically just the humidity in the air
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_013 before water evaporates it is basically just on a flat surface it is not well it could be in the cup but this gets into surface area so basically it is just a form of water that is on the surface
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_005 the form of water is a gas it just is the thing that floats around in the air or not floats but just i want to say lives in the air
myst_990502_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_024 s since the water vap er the cold water is on the inside it causes the con the condensation on er the inside of the cup
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_008 the drop on the left hand side is a medium size the drop in the center is a big size and the drop on the right is small size
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_006 water slides down a slope
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_001 it is doing good i am doing good thank you
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_009 you can add more water to one drop and less water to another drop and that is basically how it works
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_005 on other surfaces the water would not be able to s move around so wax paper was the most ideal spot for the or substance for the water
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_004 we put wax paper on the blue surface
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_003 the blue surface is on an angle and it is also the surface where the water drops or flows
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_011 a big drop should move a faster than a little drop like let us say the big drop was moving at about one mile an hour the little drop should probably be moving about a quarter of a mile a hour
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_002 the water is flowing down the surface
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_013 the water is flowing down the slope
myst_990502_2010-01-02_00-00-00_WA_1.3_012 when the slope is at a higher angle it goes faster when the slope is on a lower angle it goes slower
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_007 well when are surface d has a higher surface area it will likely evaporate quickly because that much more water is exposed to the air and evaporation
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_003 the surface area is how quickly something evaporates so like if the area is twenty-five milliliters long compared to about ten milliliters long it would be or the one with twenty-five milliliters long would be evaporating quicker
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_005 the water on the surface is touching the air causing it to be able to evaporate
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_016 these effect evaporation because well wind speeds up the process of evaporation and humidity i think slows the proces of evaporation
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_010 well they all have two hundred milliliters but and these are also the ones you used previously
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_004 the water on the surface is exposed to heat which caused evaporation
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_014 when you have smaller surface areas you get less evaporation or slower evaporation
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_015 when the surface tension is higher that is how much water evaporates and so basically and if you changed the amount of water it will have different times of evaporation because there is less or more water to evaporate
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_011 you when you roll over one of the containers container a is sixteen square centimeters b a one hundred square centimeters c twenty-four square centimeters and d two hundred square centimeters so that is basically what happens and that is how you tell the surface area
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_001 it is going good thank you
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_013 well when more water is exposed to the air it evaporates quickly so that basically is what happens
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_012 we found out that the higher er the greater the surface area is the more or the quicker it evaporates
myst_990502_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_002 we have been
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_013 you can hold a solid you can not really hold a liquid and you can breathe in a vapor so that is basically how solids liquids and vapor work
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_019 they are cubes and they are less dense than water because they are a form of ice except for they are not a huge chunk of ice they are just a small piece of ice they still ha share the same properties as as ice but it is just basically a different shape and size
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_023 the cold water goes to the bottom of the glass because it is less denser or it is more dense than the room temperature water that means it is heavier so it automatically sinks to the bottom
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_031 it actually took up more space because it gets less dense so it takes up more space but it probably would not exceed a one hundred and two milliliters of ice
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_012 it is a solid after you freeze it cause well you can basically hold it so it is basically a solid
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_032 it gets less dense causing the water to rise
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_003 we have been investigating with ice and water
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_025 when water cools it still is a liquid when it is frozen it turns into a solid and when it is heated it turns into a vapor
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_014 solid water you can hold but not for too long and it when it freezes it is a solid and you can touch it and your finger will not go right into it like it would in a liquid or a vapor
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_034 when it cools it takes up less space when it is heated it takes up more space and when it is frozen it takes up more space
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_027 cool water creates less density so that is basically what it does
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_017 the floating wooden ball has about the same density as the ice cube which is less dense than water so let us say the water was fifty dense the wooden ball would be about twenty fiveish and the ice cube would be about twenty fiveish
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_033 water takes up more space as it is heated
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_020 the temperature of the room temperature water is higher than the temperature of the ice cube so the ice cube is melting and th the cold water is going to the bottom because it is less dense than room temperature water but the ice cube itself is less dense
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_007 they would be liquids
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_022 cold water is m denser than room temperature water so that makes it sink to the bottom
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_015 ice is actually less dense than water because it floats
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_009 the water level is lower because the ice water is making the room temperature water less dense causing the water to compact
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_024 that tells me that when that the cold water is denser than regular water
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_018 that is just an example but so the wooden ball and the ice cube have about the same density but it is less dense than room temperature water
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_005 the hot water is less dense than room temperature water and cold water is denser than room temperature water
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_029 the frozen water took up more space because it was frozen and when frozen when something gets frozen the molecules line up but they do not like being next to or the atoms line up and they do not like being next to each other so they slowly sep or they separate apart causing it to expand
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_016 well when you put ice cubes in room temperature water they f float and when something floats above room temperature water that means it is less dense than room temperature water
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_008 when water cools it gets denser
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_010 density is making the water level drop below room temperature
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_006 they would be liquids
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_004 when you cool water you it can freeze and then it actually expands while it freezes and that happens about five degrees above freezing which is thirty-two degrees celsius i mean fahrenheit
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_011 when you put water into a freezer it freezes making it a solid and it expands so well there is the same amount of molecules but they expand from each other
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_030 as you increase the temperature the water compacts so or contracts so it is takes up less space than ice
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_028 when you put water in the freezer it takes up more space and it becomes a solid
myst_990502_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_021 i noticed that it took about two hundred and twenty-five minutes to melt in room temperature water
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_004 water can spin a water wheel to make a
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_012 you can tie a string and we can make the water wheel spin by shooting water on it and it can lift a string bringing objects towards us
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_007 this is a mill and there is a water going in a s in a i want to say canal from a different source which is pouring on to a mill to power the house in some way
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_005 well there is always the classical water on the slope but there is also when you spray a fifty li milliliter bottle on a yeah there is water on slopes and water on trays and there is different kinds of ways water moves
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_016 force another blade is right there so that keeps it spinning as long as there is a flow of water
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_006 when water moves downhill or flows it can power water wheels which can make different things work and water can even power cities at cause in the hudson river there are turbines on the bottom which use power er the water is current to power parts of new york city
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_014 the water is pouring onto the wheel blades causing the it to make the shaft move powering a string which does not appear to be on this picture
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_011 we got a syringe and we sprayed it on one of the plates and then it circled around lifting a string
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_019 we can have it lift a string because it is basically using a string like it is wrapping it around and it is
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_018 as the water wheel turns it it is using its force to lift a string and clips so it is basically
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_008 we have built water mills and we have put them to work by spraying fifty milliliters of water on them to wind up a string that was connected to a load of cargo and pull it out of a barrel of water
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_017 we had our water wheel lift a string with an object attached to it so and we saw how how long it took to get a string up
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_020 bye marnie i am really going to miss you
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_003 we have been making water wheels to see if we could lift objects with the power of water
myst_990502_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_010 it is a water mill which helps power the house and you have already asked me this question
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_002 we did not use the rock or the paper clip but i think they would have both sunk
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_004 those are the floaters as the computer tells me they float above the surface because they are less dense than the water
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_003 the rubber cork the wooden bead and the p wooden cork is are floating because they are less dense than the water and the paper clip rock and penny sank because they are more dense than the water
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_008 kind of blended with the other water because it kind of got stirred or mixed by accident
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_005 the cork is less dense than the water
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_007 i noticed that the water seemed to rise quick or not that quick or at a normal speed but if you mixed it around the water became the same temperature and it all turned to red
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_011 nothing surprised me about this i kind of new what was going to happen but it is always fun to redo it it is really fun
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_006 room temperature water the hot water rises to the top while leaving the warm er room temperature water on the bottom the that is because the hot water is less dense than the room temperature water
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_010 penny the warm water is less dense than the room temperature water so it it floats or rises to the surface like the cork the wooden bead and the stopper
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_001 we have been studying how warm water affects cold water and room temperature water
myst_990502_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_009 cold water is denser than room temperature water so it either stays in the vial or sinks to the bottom
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_008 well we put gravel in a cup with holes and soil in a cup with holes then we placed it on another cup or placed them on another cup and waited and more water came out of the gravel cup with holes than the soil cup with holes
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_002 we have been experimenting with soil and gravel
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_016 well some kids in my class described it as a flash flood because the water like went through it so quickly
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_013 you can know that if you want something to stay not wet when it rains you could put potting soil because less water gets on the thing you want to protect
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_006 i think gravel came from rocks and are dirt that is inside the earth or on the ground and gravel is basically broken up rocks from maybe mountains or stream beds
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_007 when we added water to the soil we er it just basically absorbed mos most of the water
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_004 i know that water can flow through soil and water can flow through gravel
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_017 i i think you already asked me this question before but i will answer again water drainage is basically how much water is passing through the object
myst_990502_2010-17-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_003 i see a pile of soil and a pile of gravel
myst_022218_2014-11-20_14-16-07_LS_1.1_009 i do not think so stupid
myst_022218_2014-11-20_14-16-07_LS_1.1_004 i do not think so no
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_011 it has many interacting parts and subsystems like animals and humans and plants
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_006 it has many different things that interact with each other to make different things work how different things
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_007 it has interacting parts that help it work and if any of the interacting parts were not there it would not work
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_003 we have been learning about systems and subsystems
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_010 all of the different interacting parts
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_008 all of the interacting parts
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_009 because it has many parts that makes the body work
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_004 because they have different interacting parts
myst_022220_2014-12-01_12-02-32_LS_1.1_005 it has different interacting parts
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_017 they are the subsystem of the earth so they pretty much communicate with everything and if one of them was gone then the whole system would not work
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_018 this is a food web which shows what what animals eat other things so what is at the bottom of the food chain means everything eats it then it shows what different things eat and what those things eat
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_003 about systems and subsystem
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_008 the interacting parts
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_012 there is many subsystems like animals plants and many other things but if there is was not any plants then there would not be humans or animals and if there was not any animals then there probably would not be humans
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_002 talking about systems and and also
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_013 i see many buildings atmosphere and many different things but without the plants there would be no houses then without the water there would be no humans then without the atmosphere there would be pretty much nothing
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_005 it has interacting parts that makes it be able to move and the interacting parts is the only thing that is making it work
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_004 because they have many interacting parts
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_016 they have different types of life form on them like the desert has lizards camels and the grasslands and snow lands and water lands have different types of animals and without each other there would be no subsystems or any system
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_006 it has many different interacting parts that connect with each other so the whole body is a loop
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_019 they show what animals eat each other and what animals are eaten by other animals in the ecosystem
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_010 could you say that
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_020 if you see an if you see an arrow pointing toward another animal that means they are either eaten by that animal or they eat that animal
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_009 because it has many interacting parts and without any of the interacting parts it would not be a whole system
myst_022220_2014-12-10_11-33-47_LS_1.1_011 it has any it has many interacting parts and without any of the subsystems or any of the interacting parts in the subsystems or in the system would not make it a whole system
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_030 i see a picture of a hamburger and a plant
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_024 yes every living thing needs air to survive because otherwise they could not breathe and they would just die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_040 i i think they do need shelter to to survive cause otherwise during winter they would just freeze up and die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_048 the plant is decaying because but it has water and air it just does not have sunlight
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_027 plants need sunlight to grow and so they do not get way too cold plants need sunlight so they can can grow and so they do not get
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_014 because they are the same type of plant but one of them is more decayed than the other
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_061 the plant is staying healthy
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_047 they do make their food but i do not know how
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_064 they are a part of a food web
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_042 because it is their main source needs for survival and without it they would just die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_065 without producers the food webs would just start falling apart
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_016 they are both types of plants
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_005 i do not know
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_067 plants need food water and air but not shelter or fertilizer
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_006 maybe because they are a type of plant
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_035 i do not know
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_053 it gets enough water and sunlight but no air
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_055 it looks sickly too because it is not been getting any water
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_060 this one has enough water air and sunlight
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_045 they grow and they feed on light energy
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_015 one of them has probably not gotten as much water
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_062 that a lot of different things feed on each other and there are decomposers producers and consumer
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_033 it yes if plants did not get food they would just die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_003 i do not know
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_025 i i think they do because i think plants do need air because if they did not have air they would all just they would not be able to breathe and they would just die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_018 sunlight and water
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_054 it makes it decay even more than it does without sunlight
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_029 yes cause then they would get too cold and die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_046 they just grow it
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_020 yes they need water to survive because whenever something is dehydrated it will die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_021 i i think they do need water because pretty much everything needs water to survive without it we would all dehydrate and die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_004 when the cookie gets wet it turns into yeast
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_011 i do not know
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_063 i have no idea
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_013 on the left the grass is a little more decayed
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_037 not need it but it is a help a helpful thing for plants
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_026 plants need sunlight to survive otherwise they would be too cold and they would and then they would they would die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_017 that plants also have basic survival needs like water and and
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_051 it will not get energy from the light energy
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_031 yes it would die of hunger and and there would be no plant
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_008 they need
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_066 they start with decomposers then producers then they end with consumers
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_036 yes because it is a type of soil and plants need to be put in soil to survive
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_034 some kind of can and a with a picture of an apple on it
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_041 it shows that plants need sunlight water and water can evaporate from it
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_056 it has not been getting any water but it has been getting air and sunlight
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_032 without a certain type of food plants will die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_057 without water it will it will die
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_058 it it does not look sickly it looks really nice because it has water sunlight and air
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_023 all living things need air to breathe
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_012 grass and it is it it is grass and it is type it is a type of plant
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_059 cause it does not have too much or too little of sunlight water or air
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_049 it has water and air but it does not have enough sunlight
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_039 plants need shelter when it is like cold during like the winter and other time
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_044 they make their own food
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_022 i do not know
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_010 they are all parts of it
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_038 it is a house which could be a type of shelter for a plant
myst_022216_2014-11-20_11-42-48_LS_2.1_052 it looks more much more decayed and yeah and orange and sickly because it has sunlight and water but no air
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_002 i do not know
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_005 uhm the human and the yeast are both made of cells they are different types of cells but they are still cells
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_010 there are brain cells and which are different
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_008 i see different types of cells
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_011 it is trying to show me that so that that these are brain cells
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_013 that uhm skin cells are also an important part of the body
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_003 those are cells
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_004 everything is made of cell
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_007 uhm humans also have several cell a lot of cells
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_012 i see skin cells which are also different from brain cells and uhm muscle cells
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_009 i do not know
myst_022216_2015-01-15_10-50-03_LS_2.3_006 uhm plants are not single celled organisms they have more than one cell
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_022 it is how stuff is it is kind of
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_001 great how are you
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_028 to take the food and break it up into pieces and make sure that it transfers to the small intestine
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_002 well we have been studying what is in your body
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_020 they both have stomach is mouths esophaguses and they both kind of depends on where they live they can live for a long time
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_029 well i know that it gets transfered to the stomach and goes into the small intestine which takes out the nutrients and then goes to the large intestines which takes out the moisture in it
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_017 i have no idea
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_016 i think that the human has more cells because well the human is bigger than the yeast and uhm they look like they are more together and they do not bunch up
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_023 if the mouth is for chewing stuff and putting it down the esophagus to go into the stomach and to be uhm taken apart
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_024 i know that it can break stuff down to go down through the esophagus into the stomach and then to the small intestine which can take it to or the small intestine breaks out all the nutrients and then the large intestine takes out the water the moisture and comes out as waste
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_014 humans are made up of blood cells and uhm water and blood and all kinds of stuff that we kind of do not know about yest because we are just in the early stages
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_015 they are all kind of together they never flow apart from each other they are kind of like a pair
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_027 the stomach takes the food into well the stomach kind of breaks it down into littler pieces and takes it to the uhm small intestines
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_004 we have been talking the human body and
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_031 well we talked about how the human body plays a role uhm well how what is in the human body and what certain things play certain certain roles
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_011 i see blue things with kind of holes and then i can see these lines kind of these squiggly little lines
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_005 they both have similar blood cells i mean cells not blood cells cells
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_013 they help go and after you kind of get a cut they will go help repair and kill the blood cell that died
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_008 i notice pink pink backgrounds with white kind of lines uhm and purple dots all over the place kind of
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_026 the esophagus plays a big a role in the digestive system to make sure that all the food gets down to the uhm stomach
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_006 uhm it is totally different
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_012 i see blue cells and i see blue kind of short squiggly lines
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_025 the esophagus transfers the broken up pieces of food down to the stomach
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_030 zero that it puts it into all the waste it puts it in the waste and then comes out
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_018 i did not learn anything about butterflies
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_010 i see some big parts with these blue lines and they kind of run throughout the body and they connect to each other
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_009 muscle cells help you uhm grow stronger they kind of help you lift stuff and yeah
myst_022214_2015-01-21_11-04-23_LS_2.3_021 the parts of the human body which there are very very many of them uhm
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_034 i am not really sure what it shows could you tell me what it shows
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_014 one of them has had more water than the other
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_026 the sun is shining down on the plant
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_008 it is bacteria
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_018 i am not sure maybe more soil
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_024 no wind kills plants when it is a very deadly wind and sometimes it can help
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_039 shelter is something you need or you do not really need it but it would be nice to have shelter like a house
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_032 i think food is very important or else is or else the world would not work like it is
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_038 it is a house
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_012 that is two plants one of them is starting to grow a little bit more and one of them is starting to die a little bit more
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_001 i am good how are you
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_040 no plants do not need shelter to survive
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_013 because on the picture the one to the right or my right is more greener is greener and more healthy and the one to the left on my left is dying is what it looks like
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_003 it is an organism getting what it needs
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_020 plants do need water to survive cause that is pretty much like humans food for them they can not live without it neither can humans
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_030 this is a burger
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_037 well no because fertilizer can kill them which i did not really think about
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_005 they are adding it to see what happens
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_025 yes i think they need it most of the time
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_017 water and sunlight
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_021 plants do need water to live and to grow
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_016 the plant is getting water and it is growing
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_022 it is showing a picture of a plant and a water drop
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_006 to live and to grow to live and to grow
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_011 we have talked about living organisms and living things and organisms
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_023 air you can not see but you can feel
myst_022214_2014-12-01_10-50-30_LS_2.1_033 it would be a problem because like people plants need food to survive
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_035 all of the food webs have a human being in it
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_017 they are interacting parts and
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_028 the pinkish whitish is for snow the blue is for the water and the green is for the land
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_012 the engine helps it go the wheels help it go the exhaust helps it helps the air come flew flow out of it
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_004 they all live on earth they all are things
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_029 because the biosphere is in those places
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_033 i clicked on the purple and it shows a system of subsystems
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_018 the earth is a system of many many many subsystems and the earth has many subsystems on it
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_002 we have been talking about different types of i do not know what to say
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_023 earth which is a system
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_038 it is showing consumers and d consumer and producers and d consumers
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_015 the shape of the heart
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_027 i see wetlands deserts kind of like part of a part of the world
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_009 there is things that are little that are parts that go in the system so that would be called a subsystem
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_026 i think the biosphere is made of water and animals
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_006 it is type it is type of a chain
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_019 earth is a planet which is a subsystem of the whole space the whole space which is
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_008 there are subsystems in the car
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_037 shows the same food that animals eat and the predators that animals have
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_036 a food web is parts of all different animals who eat the same thing or have a predator that are the same
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_021 it has a whole body pretty much that has subsystems in it which is which are technically systems of other subsystems but the earth is a big system
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_024 from what i can remember there are three subsystems which are the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_039 that everything comes from the fungi and the bacteria
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_032 i clicked on the pinkish color and i found out that it is a picture of a rabbit and all those all the things around it are things that are subsystems or systems of that rabbit
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_016 that there are different shapes and sizes of the human body
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_025 i think the biosphere
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_020 yes i believe earth is a system because it has many subsystems on it like planets or not planets but countries and states
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_031 the biosphere is part of the ecosystem which is a system that is part of a subsystem
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_013 it is a system of a body and it has subsystems like intestines muscles bones
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_014 you can see parts of the body
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_001 i am good how are you
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_022 i see houses with trees and a lake with sand but it looks like a mountain
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_011 because it has subsystems inside of it
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_030 the boreal forest and the wetlands
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_034 i think it is about a system that has subsystem and that has living systems and
myst_022214_2014-11-14_11-11-22_LS_1.1_003 the biosphere and different types of chains like food chains and body chains and stuff like that
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_004 it means that is a saturated solution
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_014 the salt solution is heavier because we know that no weight is lost when something dissolves or than just regular water
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_007 that it is slowly rising as you add more salt and after four scoops then no more salt was dissolved in it
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_002 we figured it out if a certain thing or powder looking stuff was salt epsom salt citric acid brewery glass something with the and one other thing i can t remember
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_016 we used weights and we knew that if fifty milliliters of water because fifty grams then you just subtract fifty milliliters of water minus you do the solution fifty milliliters of water and then you have how much or how much of the solution base
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_010 the sol solute i don t know the water is so saturated that it cannot hold anymore solids in it
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_011 the water has molecules and after letting so much salt epsom salt molecules in they can t hold anymore so they just let them well sent to the bottom kind of like when you eat you eat until you can t eat anymore and you throw the rest away
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_008 due so much salt in the water that the water can t hold any more
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_012 it s taking a lot longer to become saturated
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_005 well it something that can dissolve in water of course water and something to put this solid into the water with
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_013 it much the rest it sent to the bottom but the sugar is adding or you to add
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_015 the solvent that we started with was fifty grams and the solute was seventeen grams
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_017 they both have to have the same amount of solvent and solute so that they weigh exact the same amount
myst_005015_2014-02-14_09-54-27_MX_3.1_009 after three scoops it s it d be the water became saturated and the epsom salt went to the bottom
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_003 i noticed that with that if you mix different thing you can or if you mix and something else then you can get salt
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_006 it is fizzing a lot and if and after it is done fizzing up all this solute or solute goes down to the bottom
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_010 i see calcium chloride baking soda and water for the reactants to create a new substance
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_016 that no weight is lost
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_011 i saw a new product at the bottom
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_008 put it in an evaporation dish or weigh it or try putting it with other substances instead of water
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_007 if we put it through a mixture or no if you put it in an evaporation dish and then evaporated it should leave some sort of substance otherwise it just created a gas
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_001 i am doing good how about you
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_013 that it there was a chemical change
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_018 the open bag is lower or is weighs less than the closed bag
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_015 that no weight is lost
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_014 i do not know
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_004 i realize that on the left the two scoops created or made water on top and on the bottom which is a i can not remember the name of it but then the two on the right created a gas
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_012 they made it fizz up and then went down to the bottom
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_019 because the open bag left out or let the gas go out and the closed bag did not
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_017 the bag that was open let out the gas that was created and the bag that was closed kept the gas in and making it way more
myst_005015_2014-02-27_09-44-40_MX_4.2_005 they fizzed up but over time they the first one fizzed up a lot but over time it settled down and then the second one or just created a gas once it touched the water and so it did not really do much
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_003 they are all two or more things that are being mixed together
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_002 i have been learning about mixtures
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_008 it is a mixture and when we do it it will make two things go together
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_030 a mixture is two or more items and a solution is two or more items that one dissolves into the other
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_029 solutions can not be separated because they are fused together and can not be taken apart
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_024 the salt dissolves into the water and makes the water rise while the water dissolves the salt and grows and the water grows a little bit bigger
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_012 they are being separated and now are not a mixture they are all different items
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_013 they are being sorted and are now not a mixture but three different piles of the same item
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_006 half of them are food and half of them are other mixtures
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_025 i do not know
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_005 some are food and some are other items
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_022 when a mixture dissolves into a different mixture if
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_001 i am doing good
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_010 it gets sorted out into three different items and then it is not a mixture
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_014 they are being separated and it is important because the water and the marbles are now two different things instead of one mixture
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_028 no because the grapes that are mixed into the water so much that you would have to fertilize it to make it come out
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_016 the screen is catching the marbles because they are bigger than the holes but not catching the water because the water is smaller than the holes period
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_009 i would call these mixtures
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_017 it is important because the funnel is catching the sand while the water goes through the funnel meaning that they are separated as the water goes into the cup and the sand stays in the funnel period
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_026 the water will get dissolved or the salt will get dissolved into the water and the water will be bigger than before
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_004 they are all mixed
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_007 the one on the left is a mixture and the one on the right are a bunch of separate items
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_011 the three items are being sorted and now is not a mixture because they are all one or more item or they are all one item instead of two or more
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_019 the mixture is being separated
myst_005015_2014-01-27_10-24-14_MX_1.1_021 the salt dissolved into the water and created a solution
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_012 vinegar or water
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_017 the ones in the are gray and few of it s and the one and the product is different colors
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_027 before the mix the water was pure and then hydraulic acid it was sodium hydroxide i think turned into a gas that when just water and sodium hydroxide nothing changed
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_006 what happens when two or more mixed substances are mixed together with water tow or two more solids are mixed with water
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_022 baking soda calcium chloride and water
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_032 the water didn t like changed color or start fizzing up or anything and ice cubes are now just frozen water so you can t really make a new substance out of water and water that s frozen
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_011 no because there is no liquid so the chemicals didn t change they just mixed together or like they create a mixture not a product
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_003 when you mix to the vinegar and the baking soda it s started fizzing up
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_028 there are two purple molecules and a lot of still bottom molecules
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_007 we are going to make some more one of the more than one of these with water
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_015 i realized that the vinegar is a mixture of two different substances and the baking soda is just pure like one substance when they mix they mixed it are three substances which i like a dark gray and silver and blue and tannish
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_023 the water that first make the baking soda or calcium chloride phase up and then they with back down to the bottom and it s stop fizzing
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_005 they started fizzing up and then ah stops fizzing and its turns into the product
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_035 there the water started fizzing up so it since its carbonated it because stuff like that ll make it a super fizzy and it didn t and it was chemically changed when it was put in to the cup it didn t chemically changed
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_004 the vinegar dissolved the baking soda and they reacted or in the baking soda reacted weirdly basically its fizzed and then turn into a weird substance
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_043 the glow stick is chemically changing because the acid stuff on inside mixed with the water and changed into glowing substance
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_025 the hydrochloric acid and the sodium hydroxide when mixed together create a gas
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_026 the hydrochloric acid is green the sodium hydroxide is white kind of grayish but when it s mixed they create a few purple molecules
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_010 we mixed calcium chloride and baking soda we also mixed calcium chloride citric acid and we mixed baking soda and citric acid into three different cups
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_033 it created we had two substances and when they were mixed they created a new substance i think which is a gas
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_009 reactants and products
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_036 there is a reaction because the cup needed water starting fizzing up when it was put into the cup
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_046 provides information of a chemical reaction because the grapestatic alone is just powder go and mix with the water changes like chemicals inside of the water so that they are different
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_045 the water chemically changes because the grapetastic is mixed with it
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_048 today we talked about chemical changes and how if you mix some of the substances then it might be chemical change but if it s just like grapetastic and water it s not a chemical change
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_040 i think that there was a chemical change because the water didn t stay same as before it mixed into the other thing and changed i guess
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_049 bye see you later when i want to learn about more science
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_030 no because they have dissolved into the water and basically created one new substance
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_041 i mean the chemical reaction is green because the water was changing because of the green substance
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_018 i realized that the vinegar has blue and green molecules the baking soda has gray molecules and the product has a few silvery molecules at the top a few blue molecules in the middle and several tune molecules at the bottom
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_031 no because the water isn t changing its staying same and just going to the other side of the cup because the cup is so cold
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_042 the glow sticks started to glowing because the inside there is this acid kind of stuff that is in a tube and when the tube is broken it clutched out into the water and makes the water glow but when the outside of this glow stick is broken the acid gets all over and it is very bad
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_039 the green substance let into the water and turned all the water green
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_038 yes when the water touched the bike and the middle of the bike to be more specific for while it chemically changed into rust and therefore stuck into the bike
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_014 i see the baking soda mixing with dissolving into the vinegar to make a product they
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_037 the bike is starting to rust because after such a long time it got rained on and snowed on and got away so of the metal was rusting because wasn t kept safe
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_034 the carbonated water started fizzing up
myst_005015_2014-02-24_10-55-48_MX_4.1_016 they look different so they chemically changed
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_007 they have different masses and different mode of grams so it takes some longer or shorter to saturate the water
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_005 the sugar took longer to be saturate the water than the citric acid
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_016 i think that it is citric acid because it looks kind of like feathers it s flat and its clear white crystals
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_004 the difference is that the sugar takes six scoops to be saturated and the citric acid only takes four scoops to be saturated
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_008 the water is rising as we put in more salt
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_006 we had to figure out which solution out of the four or five which we had was the correct one for the mystery solute
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_014 that the one in the middle is a citric acid the one on the right is salt and the one on the left is epsom salt
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_012 epsom salt yeah no yeah epsom salt is what is on the left
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_001 i m doing good
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_011 the are after the water is evaporated they look each thing looks different
myst_005015_2014-02-14_10-06-18_MX_3.2_003 we figured out which one was the mystery solution or like how much it took to the saturate out of water
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_011 marnie i can t see the picture
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_027 i noticed that the salt did not dissolve into the water all the way so it was able to be separated
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_026 only in a mixture not in a solution
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_032 i noticed that the citric acid dissolved into the water meaning that it was a solution
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_021 that no weight is lost and that the salt plus the water equals a salt water and the two masses combine stay the same
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_038 you could remix the salt in different water so that it creates a solution and then evaporate again
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_010 solutions are when one solid dissolves into a liquid when mixtures are when one solid dissolves into not dissolves just mixes with a liquid or another solid
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_030 it is it was a mixture because the sand was able to be filtered out of the water with a filter
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_035 we put the solution in an evaporation dish and a few days later the water will evaporate out and it will be left with the solute in the cup or evaporation dish
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_042 it takes a long time for the water to evaporate and leave this it ll be
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_002 we have been learning that if you put a solution in an evaporation disk then it will leave the solid and the liquid will disappear or evaporate actually
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_018 it is growing because you put the three mixtures the three solutes together to create a mixture
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_040 i noticed that over a while the water evaporates out of the evaporation dish and leaves the salt behind
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_031 that means it was a mixture not a solution
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_028 this means that the water and the salt are the solute or a solution
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_016 that nothing disappears or evaporates into the air
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_037 you have to evaporate the liquid to to separate a solution
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_003 that sand plus water is not a solution because it is not clear water and not water plus salt is a solution because it is clear water
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_022 i do not know
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_013 the one the mixture on the right is all three of the things on the left weight into one
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_008 marnie i can t see the video
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_014 i noticed that one the water and the and the fifty grams of water and the fifteen grams of salt are mix together because sixty-five grams of salt water
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_004 marnie i can t see the picture
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_020 both masses combine and no weight is lost meaning that nothing dissolves or to send it nothing to disintegrates or disappears or evaporates
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_024 the powder did not dissolve or the flour did not dissolve into the water so we put it through the funnel or the filter the flour stayed in the filter and the water went through because the holes in the filter were small enough that the flour can t go through but the water could
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_015 that nothing evaporates or disappears
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_036 the salt water solution was separated by putting the solution into an evaporation dish so that the water could evaporate out leaving the salt or the solute in the evaporation dish
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_039 solute is left and that is important because then you have your solute back but your water evaporates
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_023 by evaporating the liquid and just leaving the solid
myst_005015_2014-01-30_10-56-57_MX_1.2_005 the sand and water turn brown and then separated and the salt and water mixture was clear and created a solution
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_017 because we were trying to separate the rocks and the water so the sieve catch the rock on top and while the water goes through the hole
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_005 you can use a funnel or a screen
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_012 the rocks are being separated from the water because the water is going through the sieve and the rocks are staying on top of it therefore separating them so it is not a mixture anymore
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_020 i noticed that needed a salt the sand or the rocks wouldn t go to the magnet because they do not have iron in them but the paperclips did because they have iron in them
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_023 i think we used the sieve because we are just trying to get the rocks out not the paperclip the sand or the salt
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_027 it means that the solute dissolved into the water and had you had to evaporate the water leaving the solute behind in the evaporation dish
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_008 that it is a that it is a mixture not a solution because the water and the rocks can be separated
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_024 i see that the water is big enough to fit through tiny holes but the sand isn t so it stays in the funnel
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_018 because paperclips are made of a metal that sticks to a magnet so if you just trying to get the paperclips out for the time being then you use a magnet to get them out of the mixture
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_021 because the magnet would get the paperclips out and leave the rest in there
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_014 a sieve and a magnet
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_029 that thing is used to separate mixtures and solution are called tools and that s a screen is best for rocks a magnet is best for paperclips sand is best a filter is best for sand and a an evaporation dish is best for salt
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_019 because some mixtures have metal in them and some mixtures have big objects and small objects in them
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_001 i m doing excellent and done great sleep last night
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_003 mixtures are when two or more solutes and come together
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_004 you can sort it with your hand
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_002 we have been talking about mixtures and solutions
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_013 the magnet pulled the paperclips out of the mixture
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_022 i noticed that only the rocks weren t through the sieve none of the other things because they are too small
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_025 i used filter because its holes are big enough that water can go through but small enough that sand cannot
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_006 there is a dry mixture and a magnet is pulling the paperclips out of it
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_011 the rocks are getting separated from the water and i think the sand
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_030 bye marnie see you whenever i see you also if like the next time we do any science experiment together
myst_005015_2014-02-03_09-40-40_MX_1.3_007 the screen is separating the rocks and the water
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_015 because the denser one kept the weightier one way down and ended up mixing with it
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_010 the one that is more concentrated will sink and the one that is less concentrated will float
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_016 because than the salt mixes into the denser the denser solution salt mixes into the lighter solution salt therefore the whole thing mixes
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_019 hi marnie i can wait to do my next experiment with you
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_011 it will float instead of
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_018 these are non mixing together and the green must be the lightest because it is on top and it is not mixing the red must be the second lightest because it was in the middle and not mixing and blue must be most dense because it is staying on the bottom and not mixing
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_005 solution a is more it is a less dense and solution b is more dense so is the water is more dense so that five grams will float and solution b and not a solution a
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_013 the lighter solution is floating and the denser solution is sinking are stay on the
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_017 because these solutions are floating on top of each other instead of mixing
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_009 the one that is less dense will float and the one that is more dense will sink
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_008 the less concentrated solutions float because they are less dense awesome
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_004 it will float
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_014 we put the solution a which was less on the bottom and solution b which was more on the top and so the next because it has to be densest on the bottom to least dense on the top but we put it densest on the bottom and least dense or put least dense on the bottom and most dense on the top
myst_005015_2014-02-10_10-34-52_MX_2.4_003 if an object is less dense than the water it will float but if it is more dense then it was sink like the penny is more dense then the cork so it drop down to the bottom but the cork was less denser in the water and in the penny so it float
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_010 because one of them has more salt than the other
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_016 three is the most concentrated because it weighs more than two solution two and solution one and solution one is the least concentrated because it weigh less than solution two and solution three and solution two more than solution one but less than solution three
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_007 the seventy-five milliliter water and twenty grams of solution is more concentrated than the seventy-five millimeters of water with ten grams of solution or solute
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_015 three weighs the most and is most concentrated because it weight more than two and one and solution one weigh the least because it weigh less than solution three in solution two and solution two is in the middle because it weight more than solution one and less than solution three
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_001 i am doing fine how about you
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_013 you can weigh each of them if you have the same amount and see which one weighs more and that one is must concentrated
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_005 it depends if it is concentrated then some times one will be darker and one will be lighter but other times it will just be the smell or something like that that you can tell and sometimes even just weighing it to see which one weighs more
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_009 my prediction was correct and the ten grams of solute with seventy-five milliliters of water went up and because it did not weighs much as the seventy-five milliliters of water with twenty grams of solute
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_019 hai marnie see you next time we do a science experiment
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_008 the one with twenty grams of solute will weigh more and make the ten the cup ten grams of solute will go up because it weighs not as much
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_014 three is the most concentrated because it weighs more than two and one is the least concentrated because two weight more than one
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_004 you can take the exact same amount fifty milligrams for example and put it into a cup and weigh them and see which one is more concentrated because it will weigh more
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_003 the one on with the gray mix you can see which one has more powder but the one with salt water mix or a solution you cannot tell which one has more salt and which one has more water
myst_005015_2014-02-06_09-40-16_MX_2.2_012 on the left the lightest gray mix is more dilute the one in the middle of the gray mix is half and half and the one on the right in the gray mix section is more concentrated than either of the other
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_018 the concentrated solution would be more concentrated and the less the less spoonfuls of drink mix would be more diluted
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_002 we have been studying if all mixtures with powder and water are the same and we figured out that sometimes they are diluted more dilute and others are more concentrated
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_007 one only has two purple crystal shards and the other has five crystal shards
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_015 there is less powder making it less dark and water is clear so it would be so it would make most things not as dark
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_006 cause it will either be darker or lighter
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_017 stronger like it is be more taste than a diluted drink
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_001 i am doing good how about you
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_014 that they are more dilute
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_020 we can also change the concentration of a solution by adding water to it
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_009 sometimes the smell the taste if it is okay to taste it and the sight one will be lighter and that is the less or the more dilute one or the less concentrated and the other one would be darker and meaning that it would be less dilute and more concentrated
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_022 bye marney and have a good day
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_012 the lightest is on the left and the darkest is on the right to me and the one on the right is darker and the one on the left is lighter
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_004 a or something like that
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_011 i think this is trying to show that the more dilute the lighter and the more concentrated the darker
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_019 different because the one with the less cool aid powder does not taste quite as strong and is not quite as sugary as the one that has more cool aid powder and it also tastes stronger
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_010 one of them will smell stronger and one will smell not as strong the one that smells stronger is the one that is more concentrated and the one that does not smell quite as strong is less concentrated
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_016 cause there is more grape drink powder in the darker one and less grape drink powder in the lighter
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_008 one of them has two crystals of powder and the other has five crystals of powder
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_021 we can add more water or not put as much water in to start
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_013 that they have more solute in them and less solvent
myst_005015_2014-02-05_09-34-24_MX_2.1_003 you take a solid that will dissolve in water like powder or something like that and mix it with water
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_009 well the bottom is the both the the top ones by but the bottom line is a pathway the top ones have though own pathway
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_024 the top ones on showing the same pathway the electricity
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_025 well it is showing the same it is showing the same the same pathway so though not going to get much electricity into them
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_018 that those showing the same flow
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_004 well it s a going out of that the negative side going into both the batteries and then coming back into the d cell
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_014 some showed on pathway of electricity and some have their own pathway of electricity
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_020 it is flowing and from the bottom of the lighht bulb
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_005 it has it is own pathway
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_028 up one because the more brighter so you can see better
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_011 the light bulbs become brighter
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_008 they both are using the same pathway
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_029 the top ones
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_015 well the tube light bulbs were showing the same pathway of energy and they will not be as bright that by it
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_017 well the flow they should the same flow so they repels was going to be as light
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_023 well the top ones are bright the bottom one is not so bright and but like the bottom one is showing a pathway what just to it the top ones out
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_021 well it is coming out of the side and going back into their d cell
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_010 that the top one is showing that it is not showing a pathway in the bottom one that showing a pathway then top one is bright and the one is dim
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_016 well some show the same the pathway and some don t but if they show the same pathway they won t be asked bright
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_027 ah umm the top two they would be the best
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_006 they both are using the same pathway
myst_007084_2014-03-20_12-45-45_EE_2.2_012 well the silly circuit it would the light bulb should would be dim but in a that was so good the light bulbs would be light
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_016 the d cell is giving the light bulb energy through the wires
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_019 the power comes from the and it goes to the light bulb and comes through the positive
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_032 it would not give it any electricity because though can be any going out into the positive side of the d cell
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_020 the negative side
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_008 it is the source that gives us the light bulb energy
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_033 the light bulb now lead up want to changes to the side
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_009 that the d cell gives like if wires are connected to it and the wires are connected to the light bulb it gives it like energy to make the light bulb light
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_002 how do make a light bulb light
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_029 both of the wire those one wire going from the bottom and those one wire going from the side
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_015 it takes the it takes the energy all though electricity from the battery in it ended though and it like mix the light bulb light
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_030 the one side of the wire is always going from the going into the side and one side is going through and both wires are connected to one is connected to the and one is connected to negative side of the d cell
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_013 they light up if it has a source of energy
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_017 its flowing all in one direction to the light because the positive side is going through the battery into the negative side
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_026 it lights up
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_031 one way has to be connected to the one has to be connected to the positive other being no connection to the light bulb so it wont light up because though has to be both sides has to though has to be two wires in the and positive to give a power
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_027 it moves the opposite way
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_022 it goes toward with the side of the light bulb and it goes up to the filament and it goes down it goes keep going forward then it goes to the positive side
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_011 if though connected to the d cell they transfer the energy to the light bulb
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_014 it means that it will recieves but it will recieves the energy from the d cell
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_021 it gives the energy to the light bulb
myst_007084_2014-02-04_13-04-00_EE_1.1_025 the battery turned and now its going the opposite way and like its going into different direction all in though the light bulb is still lighting
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_007 heat energy and light energy
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_024 they both they will not harm also and all they do is the powered by wind and the it is power by the sun
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_006 energies and you need so and types of energy for so end since the energy and energy is important because if we would energy we would have like or anything walking with that needs energy
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_027 one is like a liquid and one is just like a rock it is just solid
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_008 light and light energy
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_004 the wax is burning because its the candle is giving off heat energy from the fire
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_014 it is making sound in that sound is sound energy sound energy
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_012 giving off giving off light and heat
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_015 food energy and sound energy
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_013 those sound energy and there is also food energy because you need the food energy to make your hands move to do that
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_028 it will pollute the air
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_003 i was a candle in its layer and it looks like it giving off heat energy and light energy
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_019 it gets polluted
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_002 we have been learning about series circuits
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_005 it is not really moving because it just the light like moving so it makes and look like the wax is moving
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_021 we know impact because it s not holding though while it may it is just like looking at sun and the sun is giving the energy and that s all it is not harming the old saddle forethere if
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_025 one gets turn by wind and one takes some for energy but they don t harm those and they both
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-00-36_EE_1.4_020 it is turns to exhaust and exhaust will pollute the air
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_017 one pathway going from the d cell to the light bulbs
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_012 that represents the electricity that is flowing
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_003 it can powers things that are like one time that usually has wires the d cell may be motor some light bulb is may be it is
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_011 they it is going to from the d cell to the light bulb was not making the light bulbs light and then coming back into the d cell
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_013 trough going from the d cell to the light bulb and making them light and i think like the d cell makes the electricity move into the light bulb and to make a line that s will exactly what this pictures representing
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_009 the electricity comes from the d cell and then moves thorugh the wire to whatever hooks up to the wires
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_007 that they all in the ciruit and they all do upon a jam in the ciruit
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_019 it gets it gets less bright
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_006 to be needs should be two wires going from the and the positive side from the d cell and from the bottom and the light bulb and from this side
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_018 take more energy from the d cell
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_015 flows from it flows from the d cell into the light bulb to the filament and back to that
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_014 it has to flow to the d cell into the batteries to take them light i mean into the light bulbs to make them light
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_010 it s flowing to the d cell and both the light bulbs
myst_007084_2014-03-06_13-17-01_EE_2.1_004 the d cell is giving power from the negative both the and the positive side into the wires makethe light bulb light light bulb light
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_027 the motor starts running
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_017 the motor starts moving
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_013 the motor starts moving
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_005 the motor is working
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_030 the motor is moving
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_031 makes the motor move
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_019 now the electricity goes into the motor because it is not traveling through the metal and it is make the motor run
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_016 the switch needs to be closed
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_022 the solar panel has to get sunshine
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_020 they ah umm the sun come if the sun is shining on them it gives the electricity to all those things
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_008 those the motor on everything but the motor was not moving because those are switch and if the switch is not on the other side on with the wire dodges the own travels through the switch and will not go into the other side of the wire
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_003 those two wires connected to the part even negative side of the d cell and its making the motor moves
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_032 it does not move
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_007 those are electricity going into it
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_014 so that ended the positive side of the d cell that while is going through the metal connecting to the other side of the wire is going to the motor and that is giving the power
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_025 i will no electricity would come through it because at there was no sun on it make a interval electricity
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_034 it showing that the d cell is giving the motor electricity so the motor moves
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_026 no i do not
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_009 it is to the left and like center to the left and so it connected to the metal pole it will not the motor will not move so that means the switch is making it off
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_028 it gives the solar panel electricity to give it to the motor so it moves so the motor runs and moves
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_002 we have been learning about motors and wires and when they connect the motor moves and we think
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_010 the motor starts moving
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_004 the flag is moving and its important because that means the motor is working and its moving
myst_007084_2014-02-11_13-22-31_EE_1.2_006 it needs to get you have two wires connected to it and the other two ends of the wires need be connected to the d cell and both of them and one of them need to be connected to the positive side of the d cell one is we connected to the negative side of the d cell
myst_008040_2014-04-04_09-55-19_EE_1.1_015 and so the energy goes from the d cell then it travel all the way from the wire into the light bulb and then two light bulbs that start is getting hard and it s side and it sides getting some flickers so it lights up
myst_008040_2014-04-04_09-55-19_EE_1.1_012 energy could travel from wires
myst_008040_2014-04-04_09-55-19_EE_1.1_011 it means like a why has a path pathway is that you is that the wires is the pathway for the energy to get into the light bulb
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_004 they are about using one d cell or battery to make two different light bulbs light up
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019 the electricity does not have to pass through another bulb it can just go straight back to the battery so it is very good
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_009 there are two
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_016 because then they will burn brighter
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014 well actually they only have one energy source because that is the d cell but they have two different wires that connect to the d cell so they can both light up the exact same amount
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 for the real d cell the minus sign it the red part is a little bit by they are a little bit more of the negative side
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_004 the d ce cell is a energy disputer which send which the ener which sends energy through the wires
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_007 the d cell is having energy travel through the wires to get to the motor and then traveling out the other end to get back to the d cell
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_016 well the symbol for the battery one side is one line is a little big longer so that probably means that it is the positive side and the other side is shorter so it probaby means the negative sign
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015 well since they are the contact points they need to be there or else nothing will really work if the d cell connecting points were not there then the motor would not run so if the motor connecting points were not connected then the d cell would not really be doing anything
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008 well circuit sound of sound kind of sounds like circle so it is sort of in a circle oval shape the way it goes around
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003 those are the wires which the energy travels through to make the motor start
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002 well we just finished conducting wa well we just finished u using motors to and using stuff around the room to sort of conduct the motor
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_006 the energy it comes in from one end and go comes out in the other
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_012 it shows the symbols
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017 the and the negative sides
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011 a closed circuit is what makes the energy travel through the wires so if one of the wires was not connected to the negative side of the d cell then it would not run
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_010 it is charging the motor so the motor goes and that is pretty much it
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 i think that those are the wires that are connecting to the motor
myst_997486_2010-18-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_014 if they were not n next to the m for the motor or the d cell symbol then it would not run
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_003 we put the two magnets on one on the one cup and we put washers in the other to see how many washers it would take to make the magnets lose their magnetic field and we also put spacers in between the two magnets to make it weaker so we can put less washers in the other cup
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005 it has too many washers so that the magnets lose their magnetic field
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_015 they should do the same things
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_002 we have been we have been testing the strength of the magnets
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_022 seeing the results in the end cause it can really amaze you like on group a one thousand and nineteen washers with no spacers and nine washers and one spacer
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009 the more the spacers the less washers you have to use because the spacers are getting between the magnets so it is harder for the magnets to stick together and also because they are going through plastic and the washers are on the other side getting heavier and heavier
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_014 group c only had five in their the cup that was labeled b because they were side by side and not on top of each other and also they were kind of messy unlike the other group a b and d because those were stacked on top of each other
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_018 if you do not follow the directions or whatever then you will not get the same results as maybe the other people who are doing it right
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006 they are sticking together
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_023 yeah because there was such a big drop like from one hundred and ninety-nine that is ten washers so th the spacers must have a a lot of use
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_012 we added more well we had spacers and washers as you know and we put the spacers between the magnets and the washers on the other end
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_007 the magnetic the magnets get weaker and weaker as the washers get as the more washers get in the other cup
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_020 you need to follow the directions or whatever you are being told to do correctly or else you will get really different results
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_013 the magnets the washers in group c are side by side and kind of messy and the rest of them are holding a lot because they are stacked on top of each other and the other one is are messy
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_025 it is broken because the washer is thrown in there so hard that it kind of forces that cup down and the other cup to come with the magnet to separate from the other magnet
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004 there are too many washers for s so the a s i mean so the magnet and the other magnet can not stick together anymore and and the b cup there are enough washers to make the magnets lose their strength
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008 washers were heavy and they made the magnets lose their strength
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_019 we group a group b and group d have the same results cause they probably did the same thing and group c has really low
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011 getting further apart
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_024 yeah because then it would kind of hit the cup and then the magnets would kind of separate because of the force and then they would come back together
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_010 magnets get further apart because the more spacers you put in between the less room they have
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_021 yeah they are really fun especially the messy ones
myst_997486_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_026 well you are really good about talking s clearly and but you kind of but you are still a little bit choppy
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_011 then they all burn out sort of like how bunch of houses i if one light if one house burns out and if it is and it is a series circuit then all of the houses will burn out
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_019 it is a series circuit so the light bulbs did not burn very bright
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_009 the light bulb on the right is burned out
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_012 well one thing is that this is a probably a parallel circuit because when i clicked on one of the light bulbs the other one did not burn out
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_010 if one of the light bulbs burn out zero then none of the light bulbs will light up
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_018 with only two light bulbs
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_004 one is a series circuit and another is a parallel circuit
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_007 it is important because if one light bulb burns out then it does not affect the other light bulb
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_013 because they are both pretty much connected to the d cell
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_008 it has to travel through both light bulbs before it gets back to the battery
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_006 there are only two
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_017 then the other one will stay lit unlike the other unlike the series circuit and also the bulbs in the series circuit are are more more dull has a more dull light because they have the energy has to travel through both of the light bulbs
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_001 today we made electromagnets but ours did not work
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_015 then the other one will burn out as well as the other one
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_002 today we made electromagnets but ours did not work probably because we had a dead battery
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_016 a parallel circuit
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_014 a parallel circuit because if one bulb lights out burns out then the others will still light
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_005 well the pathways are pretty much sort of two pathways because they go through one light bulb instead of having to travel through the whole circuit
myst_997486_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_003 the one on the right side is sort of separate from the other one
myst_997486_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_009 it has to be in it does not matter which it does not matter which brad which wire goes on which brad just as long as it is the correct brad
myst_997486_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_014 the wires have to be on the correct brass thing so it can the bra the correct brass brad so it will make the light bulb light up so energy can travel through to make electricity
myst_997486_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_006 it has one wire connected to a and d so if i put it on a and d that would finish the circuit and make the light bulb light up or charge to the battery sort of
myst_997486_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_017 then the energy can not flow through to the to the light bulb so the light bulb cannot light up
myst_997486_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_018 marnie it is time for me to go
myst_997486_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_013 well it has to the mystery board has to actually have a wire on the back so it works and does not just like
myst_997486_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_003 we just finished lighting up two light bulbs with one battery in class right n a couple of minutes ago
myst_997486_2010-14-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_007 the d cell is the energy part the wire carries the energy to the light bulb and the light bulb makes the electricity
myst_997486_2010-14-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002 well today we we made an electromagnet and a lot most of our class got electricity
myst_997486_2010-14-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_004 i it is kind of like a root
myst_997486_2010-14-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_008 i answered that already
myst_997486_2010-14-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_005 it is the energy source that travels through the wire to create the electricity
myst_997486_2010-14-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_006 i see a d cell a light bulb really small light bulb and some wire
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_028 i have to go marnie
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_011 if you turn it if you by the switch then it sort of turns the electromagnet on sort of like a light bulb
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015 you can make an electromagnet
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_023 when it is connected not incorrectly or when the switch is open
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_026 it has to be connected to the electricity
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016 until you turn it off
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_017 i do not know
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009 it is closed
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024 it cuts it off
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014 then it will work
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013 you have to make it in a s sort of in a circle or else th it will not flow correctly
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_019 if the switch is closed then it cannot work and when you press the show flow button then you can see how it flows through and the wires since there are so many on the rivet then it has to circle around and around a lot of tines times
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_025 i do not know
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_021 temporary magnets do not last very long
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_002 we have been making electromagnets
myst_997486_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010 well if the switch is not on then it can not work but if the switch is well if the switch is closed then it will work and if you do not use the switch you have to connect the wires or twist them together
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 i do not know what relative means
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 well it is dropping very very rapidly but then it is starting to get little warmer just a little warmer and then it gets a little warmer and then a little warmer until it gets up to thirty celsius
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 ng hotter it might it might be getting colder and it might be getting hotter
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_025 it was different because we used pieces of ice that were centimeters and we used fifty and we used one hundred milliliters of water
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 well the ice is probably melting and there is cold water insi like the ice is cold water and cold water is going to go into your water and going to make it colder
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 well first it dropped like rapidly and then it started to like drop like to four and then it went to zero to zero again to one to one to two to zero to one
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011 well first you might look at your data and then you might and then you will you will record your data onto the graph and draw the lines to the time and minutes and look at how many degrees celsius it is
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_017 they are marking where the where the temperature temperature goes to
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 it drops way down and then it starts to go back up but it does not reach it is high point
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 it gets colder quick slower and but after a while it starts to get warmer because the ice is melted and the water well and after a while th after the ice has melted a little while after the ice is melted it will starts to get warmer because the ice is gone there is no more ice
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 it gets colder but when the ice melts the temperature goes up a little because the cup is gettings warmer because the because we are breathing on it
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 well every minute we would look at our thermometer and see what the temperature was
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013 because if you had temperature on the bottom axis then and time on the side axis you would have to draw a bunch of swirly lines instead of straight lines because you could not match them up
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_002 we have been you temperature we have been doing temperature and we have been measuring capacity and temperature
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_015 the temperature of the water with the ice in it
myst_996705_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 well you could write it down on a piece of paper you could use a thermometer and record the numbers on the thermometer
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008 well your finger can not tell the exact temperature but a thermometer can
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 how hot or cold the water is
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016 well if it is higher it is warmer if it is lower it is colder a say it was on the zero it would be zero degrees say if it was on the fifty it would be fifty degrees and fifty is higher than zero
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_013 c celsius and fahrenheit
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_020 well it is fifty degrees celsius and it is warmer than ten degrees celsius
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_026 about what
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_023 but it probably will not be lower than ten it depends on w how many degrees the middle it ha depends on how many degrees the hot water is and
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_009 well with your finger you can not get an exat get an exact answer but with the thermometer you will probably get really by or an exact a
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 that means celsius
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_003 we did not do a measurement of the water with three cups
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_027 well what is on the well it is going to be in the middle of fifty degrees celsius and twenty degrees celsius i mean fifty degrees celsius and ten degre degrees celsius so it is going to be twenty degrees celsius because fifty twenty equals thirty and what is in the middle of thirty and ten and that is twenty
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_021 it tells you that it can not be higher than fifty
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_025 well you would stick a thermometer in after estimating and see if your estimate was right and if it was not well keep practicing and you will get better at estimating
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_015 well you could use fahrenheit you do not always have to use celsius unless you like need to
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_018 well we were estimating and figuring out how what the temperature was of the the mi those two mixed together and them apart so we estimated what it would be and then we figured out what would it what it would be
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_024 it tells you that the water well it depends on how much the high number is like if the high number was seven degrees and the low number was zero degrees you would probably have like i do not know one degree water so it depends on the high number
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_010 what standard tool
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_014 well they might want an exact answer well they probably need an exact answer because they if do not has exact have an exact answer somebody could get hurt or you know
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_007 knowing wo the temperature of something
myst_996705_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_002 we have been doing m measuring the mass of things and the volume of things and the capacity of things and yeah
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_033 no ma well that a short shape can hold as much as the tall shape and it does not matter whether it is taller or shorter just matters the capacity or the what the capacity is or what the height is or what the ya width is
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_028 that if a container is shorter and wider and the other container is taller and skinnier then they probably will have the same amount unless one is filled up to the top and the other one is not
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_007 it was brown
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_029 well you have shorter and wider vessels and taller and skinnier vessels
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_006 you could use a syringe that is like a shot but yeah and so like pull back on the syringe and it will suck up the water
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_018 you could well estimate but not out of thin air like a possible estimate not like this syringe ho well this cup the volume of this cup is four thousand, one hundred and seventy-two you could not just guess out of thin air you want to have
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_013 so like if you like poured water in you would know how many milliliters of water you have
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_014 you measured the volume of things
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_030 well skinnier can hold is height but but but it is also thinner shorter does not have much height but it is wider
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_016 i do not know
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_019 well maybe si do not guess out of thin air just make your guess possible and if that if you know that should not be right you you guess again and you keep narrowing your guesses down until you think you have the right answer
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_017 you could i do not have a tool to measure with i do not know
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_022 what is capacity
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_002 measuring the mass and the volume of things
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_010 fifty milliliters unless you have a smaller syringe
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_020 well you can say i know the volume of line a which is the same distance from line b which is the same distance from lime c line c which is the same distance from line d and you could just add that all that together and that is what we did today in math
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_032 well the ta the tall vessel and the short vessel can have the same capacity cause one is wider and because one is skinny taller
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_009 okay now it is working well it is how many milliliters you su how many milliliters you sucked up right now it is at the forty so the person whose sucking up is has forty milliliters of water
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_015 the ma the volume of things
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_005 you could use syringe you could dump it out you could yeah you could use a graduated cylinder like pour into a graduated cylinder
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012 it goes up to one hundred milliliters and the syringe only goes up to fifty
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_026 you might well fill it up with water and fill up a syringe and and use the syringe to suck out the water if the syringe does not get all the water you will use another syringe and then you add together the the numbers that you got from the syringe it might be five thousand and fifty or five thousand and forty-two or fifty i do not know thirty-nine
myst_996705_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_011 a graduated cylinder
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_008 they are forming the constellation orion
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_004 they are showing pattern which
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_013 each night the earth moves around and faces the sun again in the morning so the uhm constellation turns around
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_007 i do not know
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_014 it rises from the east and sets in the west
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_006 we have been doing energy and circuits
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_016 the earth goes around the sun
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_003 i have no idea
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_002 we have been learning about or i mean energy and circuits
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_005 okay how about you
myst_012225_2015-01-22_14-00-53_SMP_4.1_015 well the earth goes around the sun and so it is turning around constantly
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_020 uhm the light reflects back over to the first mirror
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_015 i notice that they reflect off different lengths
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_010 i know that light reflects off anything so that you can see it
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_012 they are reflecting off of them
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_022 the the light hits the last star
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_011 the light reflects off of them
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_009 i am not sure
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_017 the light is shining onto the boy and then onto the mirror so that he can see himself in the mirror
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_016 light reflects off different ways when it hits a solid object
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_006 the light is turning on and off
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_004 the light is going to the boys eye
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_027 we have talked about the reflection of light hitting water and hitting different objects
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_019 it is being used to reflect like a spotlight on a building
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_024 it looks like it is being broken
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_003 uhm i am not really sure
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_002 we have been learning about energy and electromagnets and circuits
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_007 light lets you see things it reflects off things so you can see them
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_018 because light is reflecting off of it and shooting over to him
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_025 the water the light is reflecting off the water to make it look like the pencil on the left is broken
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_021 the light is reflecting off of the mirrors and it is hitting them so that they reflect onto the one other mirror
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_023 a pencil is in the water and it is reflecting to make it look like it is broken
myst_012225_2015-01-26_08-58-39_EE_5.1_014 they have to be solid for light to reflect off of them
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-18-22_SMP_2.1_006 the constellations go away
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-18-22_SMP_2.1_002 we have been learning about lights and circuits and light and the colors of the rainbow and reflection
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-18-22_SMP_2.1_004 one is at night and one is at day
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-18-22_SMP_2.1_005 the sun goes up on the west and comes or up on the east and comes down in the west and there is constellations in the sky
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-18-22_SMP_2.1_001 i am bad blah
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-18-22_SMP_2.1_007 at night there is stars
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-18-22_SMP_2.1_003 at night there is not as much light and in the day there is
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_016 one bulb is blue and one bulb is yellow
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_023 some things turn the same color but some things turn different colors
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_008 a prism breaks up the white light so that you can see all the colors of the rainbow white light is contain white light contains all the colors of the rainbow in
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_018 uhm it has light and you are breaking up the light into red
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_020 i think the color of the things would change
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_019 they turn different colors
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_003 they are all making light with energy
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_007 a candle a light bulb and the sun
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_013 the light is bouncing off a yellow ball and turning yellow and going to the side
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_029 red and green are not and or blue and green are not any different but red is redder
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_017 uhm if you make a magnet or a flashlight uhm with red uhm paper over it it turns things red or white things red and blue things brown
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_009 uhm the light is reflecting off the blue ball and turning blue
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_021 it turns the light blue
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_026 because it is green it will look greener
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_015 they are one is white light and one is yellow
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_002 we have been learning about light and reflection
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_024 the green will make it brighter green but the red and the blue are will make it look the same
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_010 uhm i do not know
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_004 you can see that uhm they are changing colors
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_025 uhm well the light turns different color things different
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_022 yellow and blue are different colors so when they are mixed together they kind of make other color
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-07-03_EE_5.2_027 they turn brownish in the green and blue light and turns more reddish in the red light
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_010 i am done with the first second
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_018 either mostly full or yeah they are mostly full
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_007 it is the rotations of the moon
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_020 crescents are uhm mostly not full
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_009 it is trying to show me that the moon goes around the sun
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_019 i notice that they are like three or yeah three quarters of the way full
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_003 uhm it looks like the moon and the how it does
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_017 it is kind of in the middle
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_004 they are the rotations of the moon so on the right said it is i think waning on the and on the left side it is waxing
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_016 it is all of the names of the moon
myst_012225_2015-01-26_09-21-15_SMP_2.3_002 we have been learning about night the night sky light and energy and all circuits and stuff
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_042 creating a solution no i mean its turning to crystals if you were like a and it evaporates which is also dissolving
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_028 of a mixture and solution so probably
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_029 have a question and i really help can you answer this but what is a solute are you meaning to say solution mixture or like solution maybe but you re saying solute i don t know what that means so please explain what solute means
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_047 ah i actually don t know the answer to that
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_030 we have not learned what solute means yeah so please tell me what a solute means you think do can do that for me please i want to know what a solute is
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_012 what is the solute
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_031 it means it will create the solution at the end because water goes through the salts into the cup
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_049 today we took the salt crystals mixtures and solutions
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_014 i have a question for you are you a real person or it just like an animated robot
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_035 it is a salt water solution no i mean a dirt water solution or same i don t know what it is like a gray materials some kind
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_009 it is more concentrated
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_034 it s a mixture now but then the water goes through it doesn t create a solution
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_041 they turn into crystals
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_045 the salt is left and it just still there because it s important and because it turns into crystal and we know we know that the water evaporates and salt it still in salt water because it changes to crystals
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_040 it is creating a mixture
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_025 we have not yet learned that in science class because we just started the unit
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_036 it creates a mixture
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_022 it is perfectly balanced
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_006 salt is going to dissolve and that is important because it stay salt water even though you can t see the salt so then the salt water go this screen and all other stuff but i kind of forgot the rest but that s know about this so far
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_044 create a mixture
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_048 i m i think it has to do with time it takes time for to evaporate
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_027 you are pouring you are pouring sorry you care pouring some water into a cone and the cone is making the water go into the thing and that creates a mixture and that is a solution and then the water goes through it and the salts stays into the cup
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_003 there is mud made from sand and water
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_020 can you repeat that please
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_007 i like tacos
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_011 what is a solute
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_013 salt salt salt answer me
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_023 salt is not as heavy as water so when i you add water it would be heavier than those chips those things are those weights or whatever they are and when you add water in it and it makes it really heavy and then it would be perfectly balanced if we add more weights and it will turn out to be sixty-five grams well usually if we do that example to show and what you re showing you know
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_016 it is now a mixture and the nuts raisins in candy or on all the solution a candy just means i think and it and it mixes all together and that changes into a mixture while they re not jelly beans and raisins are a mixture and solution
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_018 can you please answer me i don t know
myst_005012_2014-01-30_10-52-52_MX_1.2_046 the person was mixing it up
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_009 the one in the middle is the most the least concentrated because it has the most grams inside of the chemicals
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_011 i believe it would be role of the
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_019 it looks like it is i think it is salt because it says salt is square and it is looks like it is clear and white and they also like crystals so that they definitely have to be like
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_027 must be epsom salt it must be epsom salt
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_015 the one on the middle substance two is the most concentrate
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_014 it looks like the substance two is the most concentrated
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_004 you re going to answer me because you re not answering me and i already answered the question so
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_002 we have been mixing chemicals like water and salts and it also food coloring in it like we did this one when which one is most dense so the most the dense it ll go on the bottom and in it yeah in it
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_023 they have different
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_026 it i think it would be epsom salt i think that s epsom salt because this is spiking needle like crystals and they re clear and
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_018 they each have different texture it looks like they have different textures like one on the bottom looks like the one that are using in science right now
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_001 repeat that please
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_005 it is the message if concentration definitely i think it is like they are trying to see which one is more concentrate when you add scoops of add some salt and critic acid into the water
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_008 ah the one on the middle would be the least concentrated
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_007 the one on the right would be the most concentrated because it has the most grams in the water
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_021 i think you can identify the solution because they all have different textures like i ve said it
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-32-14_MX_3.2_020 they all have different textures and different differences like like that you can describe them different
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_006 what is a property
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_021 it i kind of forgot i am sorry
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_011 it tastes better when it is mixed
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_002 we have been doing science experiments
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_027 is turning into a mixture but salt dissolves and if it was had sand in it it would not go into the water in the screen
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_012 there is a peanut
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_010 these are all mixtures
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_019 for the screen the sand falls on the screen so then the water can go through
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_016 the marbles are stuck in the thingy and the water went in the bowl
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_025 even though the salt evaporates the water still stays as salt water
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_003 salad is mixed with vegetables
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_028 salt or the solution
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_017 and the water is in the bowl
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_007 the one on the left is mixed and the one on the right is not
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_005 they are different
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_029 yes you could put the grape juice back in the can but the water would just the grape juice would be purified with water
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_004 they are mixed with different objects
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_014 they are not a mixture anymore
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_022 the salt evaporates or dissolves
myst_005012_2014-01-27_10-21-59_MX_1.1_020 the sand is not going through the screen
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_016 it floats on top wait the lighter one mixes but yeah if you put the lighter one on top it will mix but if you put it on the bottom the most which is the most dense one the blue liquid solution a would
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_019 solution b has ten more grams of salt so that is why that one has to be at the bottom because then it will just go through if you put say a piece of mud or something then you put drop a rock on it the rock would go through the mud so like that is the same thing with this but i am just giving you can example
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_006 totally dude totally dude
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_013 it become fifty yeah it becomes a one hundred milliliters of
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_023 cause one is more dense and one is less dense the less dense one is the green and the more dense one is
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_002 i do not remember because today is monday and last time we did science was either friday or thursday so i can not remember
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_014 zero the blue one is more dense so it flows on top of the yellow liquid
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_018 so if you put the blue one on i mean if you put the most dense one which is solution b on top it will mix with the blue and
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_008 solution b has something that keeps it up like salt cause salt can keep things up
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_022 zero the blue one has the most grams and that makes it more dense
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_004 they float and some do not float
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_020 it has the most grams of salt
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_001 not good i am not doing so well today
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_003 it looks like a cork floating on top of the water and a penny that has sunk to the bottom of the water
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_007 it will sink to the bottom
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_005 the cork is the material is zero yeah the cork is made of wood and the penny is made of copper so copper is a lot heavier cause it is a rock and it floats and wood no i meant so copper sinks and wood is really light and light in volume so it floats
myst_005012_2014-02-10_09-48-56_MX_2.4_011 they are more concentrated so they will more be more dense like the one on the right has ten more grams of salt so that means that one put things that hold the
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_020 they look like they are different molecules
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_039 like someone is dumping water into a glass
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_047 it looks like you were bending a glow stick that is all
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_019 i i do not know
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_008 i think that would make it blow up something blow up because you are putting three different chemicals into
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_017 the molecules are a different
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_037 it is important because a new chemical
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_041 there is a reaction
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_032 i think it is because it looks the same after the chemicals are put in so it looks like they do not even
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_038 i think there it is a chemical reaction
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_015 it looks like they have different chemical in it
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_051 you are adding the grape stuff grapetastic into the water and it makes it be a different chemical
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_046 it do not know why it is important
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_053 today we learned about chemical reactions how they mix together and make a chemical reaction
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_011 i think the best one would be the calcium chloride and baking
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_004 a chemical reaction
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_021 a product or a chemical reaction
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_002 we did science a couple days ago so i i forgot
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_026 the goes to the bottom it goes it bubbles up and then goes below and it so it would be more dense than the water
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_028 there are different types of molecules and all
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_001 i am doing fine
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_035 i do not think the chemicals will hurt because i do not know why there would be water on the outside
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_043 there is a chemical reaction occuring
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_045 it the tube with green liquid made the water turn green
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_033 i do not think there is a chemical reaction i just think it is getting higher up well i do not i do not think there is a chemical reaction but i think the water is going up well i know water is going up because the ice cubes when they melt they are like it is frozen water so the water it adds more water to it and then the water will go higher up
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_042 since snow is water the water water makes metal rust and that is why the bike is all rusty
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_007 what is the question
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_030 it dissolves like i keep saying
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_016 they look like they are different
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_027 the sodium hydroxide dissolves
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_014 it becomes the product
myst_005012_2014-02-24_10-52-29_MX_4.1_003 you are making a chemical reaction and making it explode
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_002 can i call you con doc
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_003 it looks like some sugar or salt or something like that and it has some stuff in it and you put the spoon in the sugar and put in the water and makes it more concentrated if you put more spoons in to the water the water becomes more concentrated
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_015 no and every time you add a spoonful of sugar it it becomes more concentrated
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_009 i noticed that it s getting more concentrate every time
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_007 it means when you shake the bottle and it has salt in it you can shake it and then you add more salt into and then you can keep shaking and then it ll dissolve and then it ll become more concentrated every time you add a spoon of salt
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_018 its more concentrated every time
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_017 since more mass is added it is more concentrated
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_010 less than there s four cups in the water and it becomes it goes higher than fifteen milliliter because we re adding more so that it makes higher and then it goes high and then it goes higher than the red level
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_001 hi how are you doing today
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_016 it is so the salt solution is heavier than the
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_011 so it is for the orders
myst_005012_2014-02-13_10-21-48_MX_3.1_012 totally dude ah so two scoops will make it more concentrated and it yeah the water will go higher up because of the
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_012 the one on the right weighs heavier
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_010 repeat that please
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_019 the most diluted looks like a solution three
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_001 not good not good i m not doing so well today
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_014 on the very right for the grape drink mix is the most concentrated than the one on the left that s the salt water solution is more concentrated this is looks the most concentrated ones there there are so yeah they are totally like they re like so totally i m like so totally right about
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_009 so cup on the right has ten more grams yeah the one on the right has ten more grams because twenty in the one on the left is ten so twenty ten equals ten and that s ten
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_006 i m just just saying it looks nothing like a rock
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_003 zero concentration concentration and dilution or whatever it is i think it is i think it s the word
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_018 ah the one looks like the one on the
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_011 it looks like it s it looks like its taking water away from the cups and the syringe is taking them in other cups so that can be weighed and it still has more because it s like five away from the one on the left and the ten away from the one on the right
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_015 the one on the right ah
myst_005012_2014-02-06_09-40-29_MX_2.2_007 the rock weighs eighty-two more ah i mean the rock weighs eighty-eight more grams than the feather
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_013 water baking soda and calcium chloride
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_008 i think that the salt i think its epsom s i think epsom s i think it s a salt because it s a gray clear and white crystals and they defiantly looks
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_007 i think the one on the left was baking soda a vinegar and water and the cup on the right was water salt and more water
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_018 they are not equal to each other
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_017 the bag was open releases some oxygen so it went way as much because the one on the left it like capture all oxygen and it s weighing and that was is closed and so that s why the one on the left with the bag closed would be heavier
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_002 we have been learning more about chemicals like we did this like we had baking soda and the vinegar i think it was and it was like bubbling fizz thing and the back when i did the ex
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_015 twenty-five thirty-five because sixty and sixty grams is
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_004 i think that was a combination of baking soda and water because it was fizzing up and bubbling up like i ve seen baking soda and vinegar do and i noticed the solution want the cup on the left it like went to the bottom and it through that it is more dense
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_009 i think those i think that i think that those chemicals you just put in makes oxygen which is pretty cool because it blows the bag
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_001 i m doing well today very good
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_011 i feel those chemicals are created creating oxygen or hydrogen but poisoning
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_019 i just wanted to say i agreed with you you just said
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_005 it is important when you say important do you mean important to the earth or like to the experiment
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_010 i noticed that it blew up so i think it made oxygen
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_012 it looks like the molecules are different colors so that must mean they are definitely more if you put those chemicals together it will make a strong reactant
myst_005012_2014-02-27_09-43-37_MX_4.2_014 it looks like it gets heavier when you add more chemicals to it
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_025 i think it could be salt
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_017 looks like the same example to me that is what it seems like
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_008 what should i say about the mixtures marney
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_004 using a screen and or a magnet or a funnel
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_005 what did you say marney
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_014 in the tractor i really do not know marney can i ask you a question
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_011 so you took the paper clips out of a bowl and you a mixture because it is metal and that is a magnet i noticed that marney
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_012 the magnet is forgot the word the magnet is a well it is attracting the metal to it so it is a mixture
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_028 what is that
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_026 i do not know what that means please tell me what that means
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_006 what did you say marney
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_022 what does what marney what is a sieve what is a
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_020 i think it is the paper clips because those have metal in it and magnets attract metal
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_016 can i please ask you a question marney marney can i please ask you a question i kind of need to and you are not answering me
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_021 i think it is those button or m and ms whatever those are i think those would be the best because they would not fall through the screen and i thought paper clips might be able to fall through the screen because they are skinny and long and the m and ms are all fat and plump
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_013 is it is a magnet it looks like
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_018 because some mixtures are types of gases some are solids and some are liquids
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_007 the screen well the water goes through and since the rocks are big clumps and the liquid it stays and that is how you separate a mixture yes yes yes
myst_005012_2014-02-03_09-40-50_MX_1.3_010 i think the important property of this picture is mass
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_008 it means that some have higher degrees than others and this robot is trying to tell
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 which one is coldest warmest and in the middle
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_019 the ice cubes will melt and the water will get warmer
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_017 we were checking the changes in temperature every minute
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 we can do celsius or fahrenheit these thermometer show celsius
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_022 they happened a lot more when ms weller first put in the ice cubes then after about five minutes the temperature went up a degree and then after about three more minutes the temperature went up again
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014 it shows how many degrees that the thing it is in are
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 can write it down of course or
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 i see fifteen degrees difference
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 which was the coldest and which was the warmest and which one was in the middle
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 temperature is how hot or how cold things are and you can use thermometers to tell
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013 measured the exact degrees and how different all the class is measurements were
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 the robot is testing cup b with his finger
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_002 we have measured temperature
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 it is going down because the ice cube is frozen water so it is cold
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 was and if it was the coldest or the warmest
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026 i see the temperature going down a lot a lot a lot and then slowly going upward
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027 you can feel it or you can watch the thermometer or you can just or you can just look at it to see if the ice cubes are still there or not
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_015 they show how many degrees the thing that they are in is
myst_999468_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 we noticed sort a same the same degrees and it sort of rose after a few minutes slowly
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_012 we were measuring how much it weighed with water and without water and how much water it could get
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_002 we have been studying how much sponges can absorb
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_003 the le the left one is dry the middle one is wet and the right one is soaked
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_016 the sponge has absorbed water and so it is tipping the balance scale
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008 sponge has gotten bigger and more flexible and less hard
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_013 we also studied which was better for ab which could which type could absorb more water scrubby sponges zero or regular sponges we figured out that regular sponges could
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_007 it is wet so it moves it is wet so it moves more easily and it is absorbed some water
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_023 gram weights in the other cup by the sponge and it was equal
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_021 this is a picture of measurement of the sponge and he of the dry sponge and here it weighs three grams
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009 when it is fully absorbed it it will feel completely wet and and it will not get any bigger
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_020 the sponge is weighing more and more because it is absorbing water
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_010 the water drips out and it gets an it gets a little bit smaller
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_011 it is absorbed as much as it can and so that is coming out of it because it looks like it was just pulled out of the water and put in the cup and so the water is pooling around it because that water came with it
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_006 it is sort of crackles
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004 it is not very big because it does not have water in it because water fills it up and makes it bigger
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_025 it is showing that the sponge and the water together equal sixteen grams and and that the wa and it can absorb thirteen grams of water
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005 if it is sort of hardish then you know it is is not wet because water makes it move around more easily
myst_999468_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_018 the sponge is weighing more and more beca
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_023 m see you have the balance you have three grams in this one and a sponge in the other well if you see they are not tilting and one is not heavier than the other it is exactly the same see the weight it it is exactly the same it is a straight line that is how you know that there there is that this sponge is three grams
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009 well exzorb means like how about for example if you put a sponge in water and it can like it can like s it can soak in the water and that means it can drink all the water it can the sponge can drink the water and when it drinks the water it gets bigger and bigger and bigger
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_021 l put you put the sponge in there and then you add a gram is it equal well no and then you put another gram in is it equal is it equal or not if it is equal that means yes that this sponge is two grams or if it is not equal that means this sponge i
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_006 when you squeeze a dry sponge nothing basically happens it it just it just gets hard and it makes a crackle noise and nothing basically happe
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005 well if a sponge is not dry it is it is like hard it is crunchy and it is not good to like wipe stuff basically it is not wet so it will not do anything it will just like pass like this thing you are wiping w
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_014 marnie i do not get that
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_012 well that is the soaked sponge and the soaked sponge has exhorbed more water than the wet sponge and then it is absolutely bigger and like say you are going to wash your dishes say there is a dish right here and you are holding a sponge you put the sponge on the dish splash all the water comes out
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_015 well you we have a weight a measuring thing weight well you have two cups and one cup is empty and one cup has something in it the cup that has something in it would be heavier that would go to the bottom but the cup that has nothing in it would go to the top and yeah basically so that means that sponge that object in there is heavier than nothing
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_024 bye thanks thanks for letting me teach you bye marnie
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_019 seems that you have the sponge in there and when you add one little gram it is still little lighter and you add another and it gets kind of exact then it gets kind of exact then it gets more exact when you keep on adding little grams and then finally if you get a lot of grams finally the grams would lift up
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_010 when you squeeze a wet sponge the water in that sponge that it has drinked would would all come out and then and then it would go back to the dry sponge but except it would be just a little bit wet
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008 when it is wet that means it got it it was in the water and it got wet and then that is when it exzorbs the the water and then it gets bigger
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_011 marnie i do not get that
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_020 and the and the grams would go to the bottom and the sponge would
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_016 marnie i do not get that
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_003 this one is dry this one is wet and this one is soaked and when it is dry it is just regular and it is hard but when it is wet it is it gets a little squishier but when it is soaked it is really really squishy and like it it gets bigger and bigger when it gets more wet and soaked yeah
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004 well it is when it has no water in it it is very like dry and it is like not squishy at all and it is very thin and it is hard and it is just like how you buy it at stores
myst_999460_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_002 we have been measuring volume and weight yeah
myst_014025_2013-12-17_13-08-41_MX_1.3_003 mixtures are like solutes
myst_014025_2013-12-17_13-08-41_MX_1.3_002 solutions and mixtures
myst_014025_2013-12-19_12-28-38_MX_1.2_001 i am better than yesterday
myst_014025_2013-12-19_12-28-38_MX_1.2_002 we have been learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014025_2013-12-19_12-28-38_MX_1.2_007 because they are marni because they are
myst_014025_2013-12-19_12-28-38_MX_1.2_006 told you before it is a solvent
myst_014025_2013-12-19_12-28-38_MX_1.2_003 the salt and sand mixture is a mixture but the water and salt mixture is a solution
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_006 the salt and the water mixture evaporates i mean dissolves
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_002 we are learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_013 the salt it is called
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_008 the water is mixing with the grapetastic grape mix and it is mixing
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_014 it is all the weight of the three other items together
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_001 not so good
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_012 the solvent is the water
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_007 the salt dissolved but the sand in the water did not
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_005 the sand is mixing with water and making muddy water and the salt is mixing with the water and making salty water
myst_014025_2013-12-18_13-01-36_MX_1.2_003 that some things some mixtures are solutions like for example the water and the salt mix together and the salt is transparent and like kinda gone
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_007 the trail mix is mixed together the chocolates on the next side is just a pile of chocolates and the next things is just a pile of nuts and then the next thing is just a pile of raisins
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_031 no the grapetastic mix is mixed into the water so even if you tried multiple times it would not separate
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_003 these are all mixtures except for the water and the top right i guess
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_002 we are learning about mixtures and solutions mostly mixtures i think but we are doing stuff like mixing sand with water and salt with water and weighing it by grams
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_009 a mixture or a solution
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_008 it is a mixture because you are mixing two or more two or more things and they keep their properties
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_023 evaporation takes the water out of takes a item out of out of water and then the water never mind it is called dissolving
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_028 the salt dissolves
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_011 one what is your name and two there the the mixtures are separating into separate properties
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_013 they are being separated into different piles
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_010 the mixture of the trail mix is separating into different piles chocolates nuts and raisins
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_018 it took out a item
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_032 mixtures keep their properties and solutions mixed together
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_020 the salt evaporates so it is not there anymore well it is there but you can not see it
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_015 the marbles separate from the water because there is a screen
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_017 well the there is a foss separator thing and it separates the water from the sand because the water can go through the paper material but the sand solid can not
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_014 the water is splitting from the marbles because there is a screen and marbles can not fit through those tiny spaces
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_026 the water mixes with the salt and then the salt dissolves later the water evaporates and you can see the salt crystals again except bigger
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_016 the screen is blocking the marbles to go into the bowl of water
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_033 i hate you
myst_014025_2013-12-12_12-58-23_MX_1.1_021 the water is now clear
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_022 it is time to go
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_020 the dependent variable is the y axis is the passengers and the x axis is the capacity of the boat
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_019 it told me what the
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_011 well if you put a whole bunch of pennies on one side then it will like tilt the boat and water will seep through and get more capacity and if you like spread them all apart or stack them in the middle it will not like tilt to one side or the other to let in water
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_004 while we were trying to figure out how different sizes of boats could how much capacity the sizes of boats could hold
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_006 it is about how you could like changing variables to get your answer to your question
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_005 we we tested them to see how much the different sizes of boats could hold how many passengers they could hold and then we got two others so we had a total of six and then graphed them in our science notebooks
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_015 well we took we first filled the boat up with just plain old water and then poured it into like a measuring tube and we found out that that is the capacity and we took that same boat and then put on water and put pennies in it to see how much how many pennies that boat could have
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_008 it is important because if you change five variables at a time then you do not know what went wrong or what made your q like what answer you got because you changed five variables instead of one at a time
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_014 well i had a boat that was i think two centimeters and it held the capacity was thirty-three and the number of passengers it hold held was seventeen
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_021 you asked me that question last time like the last thing you said
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_012 the variables we did was first we changed the cup size and then we slowly put the pennies in the boat while it was floating on water
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_007 when you do not change your variable it stays that way and the vari variables you do change your experiment probably would change
myst_996435_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_003 we finished making our boats and then we graphed all our boats two others
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_022 are we out of time or not
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_006 the it is going by ones and it is going like skipping four squares and they
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_011 it is the variable passengers going by ones and y we and you did t thirty-five winds and like probably
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_005 it is the the graph and then in the y axis that is probably where how long it flew the plane and the x ax axis would be like h how many passengers it could hold
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_008 well i did not know but i am just taking a guess probably the dependent variable would be in the y axis
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_014 zero so probably you will not change like a lot of things of your plane because and like you will not really know what what to what made the plane faster or slower
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_009 in the y axis in our classroom we we put how f how long the plane flew or flied
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_019 well independent variable would be like you have to switch one variable at a time
myst_996435_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_007 well in the x axis we put in our classroom we put like how many passengers it can hold and then in the y axis is how many how far it the plane could flew
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_007 so you can solve your answer
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_006 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_019 the length of the string when it is high it has low numbers of swings
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_020 a longer string has little number of swings and a short string has a big number of swings
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_012 penny is the bob
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_008 when you have a long piece of string you will have shorter amount of swings in fifteen seconds
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_003 they were about seeing how far we we can make the pendulums swing with different lengths of string
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_010 in fifteen seconds it did five swings
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_017 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_016 the longer the string length the shorter amount of swings the pendulum will make
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_002 we have been working on pendulums
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_004 we got different lengths of strings and see how many swings it would make in fifteen seconds
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_014 the bob makes the string swing
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_009 there is a whole bunch of pendulums
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_011 a penny and a paperclip and a string
myst_996435_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_015 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_018 probably since they are the same boat size but probably the person put the pennies in like different places probably in like boat a they put it all in one side and like boat d they probably s like either stacked them all up in the middle or they laid them flat and spread around
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_008 we figured out how much capacity the boat different size of boats could hold
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_003 r paper boats and we are seeing how much capacity and passengers a boat can hold
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_019 can you repeat that
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_013 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_007 there was nothing important about it we just tested to see how it would change anything and it did not
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_006 we built it out of paper cups and they are like little small ones and we cut them with scissors between two centimeters and four centi centimeters
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_021 i think i have to go now
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_005 they are not lifeboats but we made them out of paper cups
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_002 we have been making paper boats
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_011 if you put too many pon pennies in one boat it
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_016 well if the water is like really wavy some waves could like fall into the cup and like add more weight to the cup to make it sink faster and we do not drop the pennies in we just kind of like place the pennies into the cup
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_020 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_004 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_014 i think one has more pennies than the other because it is like all stacked up into the middle and it will sink faster if like all the pennies are on like one side instead of like in the middle or spread out
myst_996435_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_010 the more pennies you put in it has to not sink and like that is how much capacity it means cause capacity means how much the boat can hold
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_008 i notice that the shorter the length of the string the long the more number of swings it made
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_018 i know that when it says the length of the string is at two hundred centimeters it only made five swings and when the length of the string is twenty centimeters it the number of swings it made was twenty
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_004 the pendulum length means how long the string is and the number of string sign is tells you about how much the that number of length of string of swings it made
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_013 it tells me that the longer the string the least swings the pendulum will make and the shorter the string the more swings the pendulum will make
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_006 the numbering system is about it says on the the pendulum length that like it goes 10s get counts by ten all the way to two hundred and the number of swings it just counts up by ones to twenty
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_007 you can figure out how many of something
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_014 with a twenty meter string you will get fifteen swings
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_003 it is about the pendulum lengths and the number of swings the pendulum makes
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_010 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_005 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_012 when you use a graph to help you predict you can get a better conclusion
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_011 when you use a graph it tells you data
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_015 instead of just guessing a conclusion you can actually like know what the conclusion is instead of just guessing it
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_019 could see that the length of the string is a really big number then you would get a good idea that the number of swings would be a low number
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_002 we just finished the pendulum experiment
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_009 i do not know
myst_996435_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_017 the higher the s string is then the less number of swings it will make
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_033 i noticed that the distance meets up with how many passengers you put on the plane
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_011 it is important so then you could see how the changes like you have your variable and then like what you changed on the variable and like another thing that like you either have to move or you have to like
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_032 you already asked me that
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_002 we have been testing out planes to see like how many passengers they would carry and how much distance that would
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_014 well if you have like if you have like the number of passengers and the distance you could say that four passengers went only ten inches with twenty-five winds
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_018 the this person had one like one passenger and only did ten million, two hundred and three thousand and forty or fifty winds the of the plane and they still do not know what the distance is
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_003 it is about a it is a graph and there is a y and x axis
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_015 well it says th that this person did thirty-five winds and went up to five passengers and so and i guess they did not do the distance yet
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_021 yeah the number of passengers is the variable on this table of data
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_030 well if you do not have a variable you are testing then it is kind of hard to do your data table or your graph because then you can not really see accurate data because you do not really have a question or anything to put on here
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_016 i just noticed something on the one you just showed me before it is a variable on top of the number of passengers and that says variable on the number of winds and it says that they only added one passenger but changed the number of winds they did
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_037 same with you bye
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_022 i just said that
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_020 on this one the the variable is the number of passengers and they did thirty-five winds and they went up to five passen
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_029 well like one passenger it went to three hundred and twenty and you can see at the distance that the numb the distance in centimeters at a like meet with the one passenger
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_005 the y is the distance and the x is the number of motors but what we did we did not do number of motors we did number of pa passengers which were paperclips not rubberbands
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_004 that is to see how you like if you have if you do not have y or x axis is then
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_028 well you need a data table so you can like put it on your graph and if you like just randomly put dots that is not an accurate graph and second is that we did not test motors or rubberbands we test paperclips that were passengers so yeah
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_034 thanks for telling me
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_036 thanks for all your help too
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_019 the number of winds cause it is the only thing that changed because you do not know the distance and the number of passengers there is only one
myst_996435_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_012 you already asked me that question
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_010 we only flew it one distance that is two yards because we did not have time to do any other distances
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_007 it is about that when you twist up the propeller then it will move forward and yeah
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_015 well if you are making your plane go up like the second one in this picture then it will probably be harder for the plane to go up and if you are making it go down like a ramp it will probably like make it go faster because it is like going downhill and when it is straight it has the same whether you do it either way
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_008 it is important to make sure that you twist the plane the right way and that you build your plane the right way so it flies correctly and if you do one of those wrong then
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_013 well the only way you can get your plane to move is if you spin it and if you do not spin it it will just sit there and if you spin it the wrong way it will just sit there
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_019 well if you maybe you could like oil the string and and see what could happen then or maybe you could change the length of string or the length of the propeller
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_020 well maybe if you oil the string then it would make the plane slip a little bit and then you could see how that would change your experiment
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_025 i like visiting with you too
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_002 we have been doing planes and seeing what the distance would be on how many turns the plane will make
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_012 we only did we only like changed one variable cause we did this yesterday and today and we only changed the weight by adding paper clips for passengers instead of pennies
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_021 well if you just change a variable for no reason then what is the point of even changing it and if you change a variable for a reason then you could say well i changed this variable because maybe this and this would happen
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_014 one plane is going on a straight string and the other plane is like doing kind of like a diagonal
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_024 we were surprised that how difficult it was cause the instructions we followed was like really easy seemed easy but hole punching and stapling and and just like building it was pretty difficult especially sandpapering the sticks that took a while
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_005 the plane is moving across the string
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_023 well if you spin the propeller counter clockwise we tested that and our plane like barely moved and we spinned it clockwise and it moved how it was supposed to
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_011 probably like one is like if you fly your plane from a farther distance then you will have to wind up the plane more so it can go farther and if you did it sh a shorter distance that is what we tested then you have to wind it up less or else it will like bang into the chair
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_009 would see that that your plane will not fly like all the others
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_004 well first we had it to build it and then we test it to see how many zero wind ups it will make to go all the way to three fourths of our string that we hooked up from two chairs across the room
myst_996435_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_022 you try to find out what like you would have a question and then you would try to find out the answer to your question and changing variables would help you find your answer
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008 well th the sponge with no water in it has just stayed out of the water and dried up
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_023 well so at first when the sponge is in the measuring the weight it is on the bottom and then we just dropped pieces grams into the other cup and then it will go up and up till it is even but if you put too many in it the grams will be heavier than the sponge
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_011 n it is kind of been just soaking up water
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_021 well we got the sponge put it in the m measuring on the weight and then we put grams in to see and then we added up how many grams took to get the sponge and the weights even
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_012 well when it is full it will be very big and there will not be very much water and it will just kind of be very much bigger than it was dried around two or three times
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_010 well the sponge in the middle it is wet so it has been in the water for around maybe five or ten seconds and maybe around fifty-one thousand and fifteen seconds and it has been aborbing
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004 one is getting wet and soaking up the water and the last one soaked and it dissolved all the
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_024 well we just kind of me and my partner james we just kind of put some a dry sponge and and dropped the grams in we estimated it would be around three or four grams and when it got even we just stopped and wrote it down on our paper
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_025 we well we just kind of picked up the sponge and we just kind of thought how heavy it was and we thought that it would be around three or four grams and that was how and that is how we estimated
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_028 thanks my dear bye
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_003 so th there is a dry one that has a all the water in it has evaporated this the
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_013 well when the sponge is very dry and stuff has no water but when you put it in the water goes into it and cause it can not stay it is small firm it will have to get bigger and bigger
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_002 well we have been measure measuring volume and stuff and we have been mainly working with tools to fill up a little g plastic cup of water
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_020 okay so right now the sponge is dry and has no water in it and it is evaporated so it is much more lighter cause all the bubbles in it is full of air instead of water
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_007 kind of just soaked up all the water that it can hold
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009 well you can just squeeze it and it will be hard to squish and also no water will come out
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_019 well cause there is soap cause the sponge weighs something than just the cup so the sponge is heavier than nothing in the cup so the wet so the sponge is going down and the empty cup is going up
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_022 well the dry sponge weighs around three grams so and then when we put this grams in it got exactly even
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_015 well a ton of water comes out and it gets smaller and smaller and if you squeeze it long enough it will become dry again
myst_999469_2009-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_018 s i do not really know what a soap sponge is
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_004 we can filter it
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_019 i noticed the paper clips come out of the water with a salt and pebbles because the magnet is attracted to metal
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_005 there is sand with metal objects and wood objects inside and there is a magnet to get all the metal stuff out of the mixture
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_022 to separate solids from liquids
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_018 say that again marni
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_016 to get the pebbles out of the sand water
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_006 you are filtering the rocks out of the water
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_028 it is we went over mixtures and solution and how to separate a mixture
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_024 we used a filter to separate something that is very small from the water to the
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_008 so that you could get the solids out from the liquid
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_026 means it is a solution
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_027 it is a solution
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_025 the last one is the best to make
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_007 solids and liquids
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_015 a solvent and a solute
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_010 solids and liquids
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_014 can you say that again marni
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_021 say that again marni
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_023 you filter it to get something that is almost stuck to the water to get out with the
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_017 because they are a magnet attracts other metal things to attach to it
myst_014035_2014-01-09_12-35-39_MX_1.3_003 a mixture is something when you take two of the different things and put it together
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_021 the salt disappeared in the water and it is a solution
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_005 a salad is different than marbles and trail mix because they are just different things and then the wood chips and paper clips are two different things because they are wood chips and paper clips
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_009 that is a mixture and the salt and water is a solution
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_012 they are sitting there
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_010 it used to be a mixture because it was more than one thing coming together and then you separated the candy from the peanuts and the raisins so that made just a straight up thing
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_020 the salt and water is a solution and the rest are mixtures
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_025 i do not like you marney
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_015 they got separated because of the
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_008 it is a mixture and it is important because it is more than one thing coming together
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_030 the difference from a mixture and a solution is a solution
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_011 it got separated
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_024 it is the it made the water bigger because it is like fifteen grams fifty grams of seashells sixty-five grams so it makes it
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_003 the salad is a mixture because it is more than one thin coming together the marbles are a mixture because there is water and marbles the trail mix is a mixture because it is more than one thing getting put together and the wood chips and paper clips are a mixture because wood chips and paper clips are two different
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_017 the coffee filter held the sand but let go of the water
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_026 the water is fifty grams the salt is sixty or fifteen grams which equals sixty-five grams cause i know my math facts very well marney
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_007 the ones on the left are a mixture because there is more than one thing coming together and the one on the right the three to the right are just they are not mixtures because they are the same thing in one pile
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_028 because it made the water taste like grape because it is a solution and they mixed together so it is a solution
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_002 learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_016 the grid separated the water from the
myst_014035_2013-12-18_12-38-54_MX_1.1_013 they got separated from each other because that is a
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_003 a salad is a mixture because there is more than one thing getting mixed and there is trail mix because there is the same thing as a salad there is more than one thing getting mixed and then there is marbles and there is wood chips and paper clips and wood chips and paper clips are two different things so they are getting mixed too
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_014 you are separating the marbles from the
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_022 that is a solution because it mixes into the water and they become one just salt
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_017 the sand is a solid so the filter can not the filter can only pour down the water but it can not pour down the sand because the sand is a solid and the water is a
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_010 they get separated and that is important because it could
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_020 the salt will dissolve because it is never mind
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_013 they are getting separated
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_007 the one on the left is mixed together with all three things the one on the right the three on the right are separated
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_011 they are getting separated from a
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_006 there is a salad marbles trail mix paper clips and wood chips
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_030 will you please repeat it marney
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_023 the salt disappears the salt will dissolve to form to form the ocean
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_005 i see a salad marbles trail mix and wood chips and paper clips and they are different because they are different solids
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_018 we made a solution by using a filter and the filter separated the water from the sand
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_015 the marbles are getting separated from the water
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_025 i am not sure
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_029 because the salt and the grapetastic mixed with each other and made a
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_004 i am not sure
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_019 the filter separated the water from the sand because the sand is a solid and the water is a liquid so the water got poured into the cup while the sand is still stuck in the in the filter
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_002 learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014035_2013-12-12_12-39-00_MX_1.1_016 the water and marbles are getting separated because there is a grid and from there is a grid and the marbles are solids so the only the water can go through because it is a liquid
myst_014035_2014-01-30_12-31-19_MX_2.4_020 that means it floats on top of the heavier solution
myst_014035_2014-01-30_12-31-19_MX_2.4_021 we can we can that solution a is less dense then solution b so solution a floats on top of solution b
myst_014035_2014-01-30_12-31-19_MX_2.4_026 you can tell it by how dense each one is twelve is twelve
myst_014035_2014-01-30_12-31-19_MX_2.4_027 the denser ones are on the bottom because the blue can hold up the green and the
myst_014035_2014-01-30_12-31-19_MX_2.4_022 they both have the same amount of salt
myst_014035_2014-01-30_12-31-19_MX_2.4_023 because solution a is less dense than solution b so solution so they mix together because solution a can not hold up solution b because it is less dense
myst_014035_2014-01-30_12-31-19_MX_2.4_024 because solution b is heavier than solution a
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_004 by how dark they are
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_010 that the solution to the right weighs more than the one to the left because there was twenty grams of solute and the other one has ten gram
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_017 number is the most concentrated number three is the most diluted
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_015 number one is more concentrated
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_011 because one is more concentrated than the other
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_005 i am very familiar with a balance
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_014 three and two are the most concentrated and number
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_013 you can tell because one each one is darker or lighter than each other
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_007 one is more diluted than the other
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_008 one has more of a solution than the other
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_009 it would balance out the same
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_016 number one is the most concentrated and number three is the least concentrated
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_006 the rock has more mass than the feather so it weighs more
myst_014035_2014-01-29_12-33-39_MX_2.2_003 say that again marni
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_021 if you mix flour and water you get a mixture and when you pour it into the coffee filter the water gets separated from the
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_038 i do not get this marni
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_005 what is a mixture and what is a solution
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_012 that grams plus grams equals gram
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_036 the water evaporated and the salt stayed the same and made it
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_018 that water fifty grams of water fifteen grams of salt equals sixty-five grams of salt
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_033 from a filter
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_040 i noticed that the water evaporated and the salt just stayed on the petri dish because it is a solid not a
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_007 the salt dissolved into the water which is a solution
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_020 using a coffee filter
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_037 use a petri dish to separate the water from the salt and the salt turned into crystals and the water just
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_003 the water plus the sand equals sand water and then the water plus the salt equals salt
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_013 how are you today marni
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_017 grams plus grams equals grams
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_022 a or a mixture
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_043 we have learned about mixtures or solutions and how they can be separated
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_014 a candy plus raisins plus peanuts equals a mixture of fifty gram
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_016 three cubes plus water equals the same amount of mass because they are the same heaviness
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_034 you are mixing salt and water to get a solution
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_011 fifty grams fifteen grams equals sixty-five grams because the solution it was a solution and the water plus the salt the water was fifty so if you add that it would be at sixty-five grams
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_024 that the salt and water gets mixed and the salt dissolves and it turns into a solution and then when you pour it into the filter the salt stays in the filter but the
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_028 that means it is a mixture marni
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_039 the salt is left and that is important because the
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_008 the grapetastic is going to dissolve into the water so the water is the solvent
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_002 i have been learning about mixtures and
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_030 it is a mix
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_006 the sand and water mixture is just it is a mixture and then the salt and water is a solution
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_009 the salt is the solvent solute and the water is the solvent
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_015 the mass gets bigger a boom boom pow zero crap
myst_014035_2013-12-19_12-40-44_MX_1.2_025 it means that it is a solution and that the salt got stuck in the filter but stayed in the
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_004 we are putting grape fantastic grape fantastic into water to make a solution
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_014 you can tell by weighing it from if one is more concentrated than the other
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_009 there is more of which in one than the
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_003 you can get salt and water and then mix them and it will almost look like the salt disappeared but it did not
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_006 i am not sure
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_007 it is darker than the other
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_011 a graduated cylinder
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_002 mixtures and solution
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_013 one has more of a solute than the other
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_010 can you say that again
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_015 that one is has more solute than the other
myst_014035_2014-01-15_12-44-34_MX_2.1_016 that one has
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_019 an omnivore i think is well it eats meat but also eats like plants like say like berries or something
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_008 when they eat the food the animals get their energy
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_021 a omnivore eats all well so if omni is the prefix of all that also means like so omnivores are animals that eat all things like meat fruit and vegetables
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_015 these are the ones that well like those are the ones kind of like at the top of the food chain i think

myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_011 decomposing rotten food and the food that they decomposed gave them energy
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_027 can you please name all four
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_033 that helps them with their food and that is a part of a ecosystem
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_003 this shows us consumers producers and decomposer
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_017 they are both animals right
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_032 the waste is the worm is food
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_013 these are like pictures of a well of decomposers producers and consumers
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_030 they are chomping down the paper and leaves and turning it into dirt that means they are decomposing
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_026 a worm is a decomposer
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_018 they eat meat
myst_002116_2014-03-04_09-24-51_LS_1.3_024 the moose is a vegetarian
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_002 about well we are learning about like veins and the living systems you know like the veins and xylem and phloem
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_021 i do not know
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_001 good how are you
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_015 this is showing xylem and phloem
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_003 leaf this is a leaf with a bunch of veins you can see
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_010 it is palmate no i forgot
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_006 they all have different like shapes of veins in them like different ways it goes leaves is a different shape like i remember one of the was parallel
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_013 to help travel the sap and the nutrients and cells
myst_002116_2014-04-04_13-06-45_LS_3.1_007 they all have different shape they all have different shapes of veins
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_047 if it does not get any of this stuff well then it guaranteed going to die
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_007 something that is living
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_021 well actually not really because if it has just one thing it helps them make water and die
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_062 that plants are
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_055 it is also not getting wind like it also needs
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_018 water sunlight and dirt or soil
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_057 it is also dying but not as much as the last one but it is not getting any water and that look like it also needs that material and if it does not get any water it is not going to live and like i said proceed it is life
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_020 yes it does
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_060 then that means it is getting all the things that it needs
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_054 it is dying even more and it looks all crusty
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_049 producing the energy from the sun
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_038 no because plants use fertilizer but they do not have to use it
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_053 it means it is getting no food and if it does not get any food it is not going to live
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_063 can you repeat that again
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_065 it starts with the decomposers then to the producers then to the consumers
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_043 they need carbon dioxide and oxygen and why is because sometimes that helps them survive and have a better life like a plant
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_050 wind it does not get water no wind no oxygen no carbon dioxide well actually that is only just what it is like when it gets water and wind
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_027 it is showing a apple
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_045 by their blood cells and their leaves
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_058 it does not need as much as it needs with water
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_040 it needs a safe place to rest
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_061 that food webs are important to life
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_052 it is not getting the right materials that it needs to live
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_001 how are you
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_044 please repeat that again
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_034 yes that can be a problem because if it does not get it is food it could probably may die
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_032 yes almost you can a one million
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_056 that is not one of them it is a material that it needs and if it does not get that it is not going to proceed and live it is life
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_046 the food they well they produce their own food through the light from the sun and the energy
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_005 it is making the yeast active
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_042 it needs wind it needs soil it needs sun and it needs those important stuff
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_010 through the fact that that is like maybe like bacteria or something like that it is like bacteria is to us like but that is like bacteria for them
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_002 i have been studying about the growth of plants
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_006 because they are also a living thing
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_026 yes because it is a burger and plants are they think decomposers which they need just kidding they are not decomposers but they need food like burgers
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_015 can you say that again
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_003 something with growth
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_066 we have been learning about food webs plants living things and how plants need air sun and water
myst_002116_2014-03-10_14-10-38_LS_2.1_041 no because plants actually sometimes will not have shelter but they mostly do need it
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_046 it is like a little tube where the chewed up food goes and leaves into the stomach
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_042 break down food
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_055 we went over the human body we went over blood cells we went over the digestive system
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_021 skin cells almost
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_015 these are brain cells
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_056 what is your name
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_006 good how are you
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_030 the leaf has all these different looking cells and the human has just like three or four looking ones but the human also has multiple different ones
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_038 you know i really really really really hate you right now
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_003 that is yeast
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_024 no they are just like animals are just like humans and like humans are animals too and they are all made they are all made of skin cells blood cells brain cells
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_025 they are both
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_052 that they are like the last stage of
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_043 it chews up food
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_012 pink like pink strips with purple spots in it
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_018 these are skin cells
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_028 i see maybe plant well a a leaf well this is a picture of a leaf blood cell of leaf blood cells
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_023 cause they all have a different type of unique
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_037 it they both are living
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_051 it has this stuff that protects the stomach so this like type of acid that in the acid it kind of burns down the food
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_013 they are pink and they
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_020 they are thin tiny cells in a skin in skin
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_008 these are individual blood cells and they might be living
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_014 they they are muscles muscles they look like little strips of pieces of taffy
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_032 they are all living systems
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_031 that they are just like that they are just like animals
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_041 it breaks it down
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_016 that the purple things are brain cells
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_026 that they both have different blood cells
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_017 that they are in your brain
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_034 a butterfly is living
myst_002116_2014-03-21_08-14-25_LS_2.3_004 wait a second is this the right place i am supposed to be going into
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_008 the many parts it has
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_022 the life and all things like trees and plants and and fish and even human
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_014 there is like the digestive system there is like the blood vessels in the heart and there is like the brain
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_005 the car is a system
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_028 the biosphere is part of earth and earth is an ecosystem
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_001 good how are you
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_017 yes because earth has many different parts that work together to make up earth
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_027 sand and places like
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_015 the earth is also a system
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_009 wheel helps it roll
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_029 this picture shows me a maybe a food web or and life
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_026 well wetlands have frogs and plants and fish deserts have like scorpions and snakes and and the forests have like bears and moose and trees
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_035 can you repeat that
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_021 well the trees are part of the
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_013 all the parts that makes it a system
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_036 bacteria is a decomposer some fungi is a decomposer and grass is a producer
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_033 what animals eat and what animals get eaten by animals are part of the biosphere
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_024 i see a desert i see well a forest i see
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_030 it shows me like a fox a bunny a human a bird like a bug a flower like mud and grass or like i think that is like a mouse
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_006 the wheels can move
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_004 a car is a system with the many parts like the wheel
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_002 i have been learning about systems and like your body is a system a suitcase is a system and the earth is a
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_011 it shows me part of parts of the human body and what makes it a
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_034 a pine tree and produces it is food
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_025 the light blue represents the wetlands the yellow represents the deserts the purple represents like the freezing places and the dark green represents the forests
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_003 a car a suitcase the earth a human body
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_007 the car has many parts like the exhaust
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_012 all the places where the heart connects to and the blood vessel
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_010 human body is also a system
myst_002116_2014-02-27_09-29-01_LS_1.1_016 it it has land it also has water and it has the four spheres
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_016 the two and it is the teeth
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_013 by the patterns on it
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_008 how it how it shows in the patterns on it
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_009 people have noses
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_022 the uses the rattle on the tail
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_019 predators and prey
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_018 it is the number one which is the wings and its bright colors
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_017 because it likes so basically chomp the meat and break it down to little pieces
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_021 it makes like it makes people get like it is basically showing like another animal to back off you know
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_015 it uses its webbed feet to like push water that help makes it swim and go
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_002 about animals and how they get attracted and a bunch of their systems and how they get noticed
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_006 that they have different colors and stripes and turns on them
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_005 how they blend in or show in the in their habitat
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_023 animals and adaptation
myst_002116_2014-04-30_11-52-58_LS_4.2_020 the the person is scared because the snake eats could eat her the girl
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_010 i do not understand that question
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_019 first you start with the heaviest and see if that if that weighs as much as the orange if it does not then you then you add the little ones and then you start adding the big ones if it still does not add up
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_008 i would compare it with a different object
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_004 i do not really understand that
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_007 i do not understand that
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_002 we have been measuring water and stuff like stuff like that
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_021 then you find a different object
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020 the orange weighs a lot more than those grams
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_017 i do not underst
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_011 you ca you compare it with the nickel
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_022 you do not measure the object anymore because you do not have enough grams to measure it or you get a different object and you if you know how much that object object weighs and if it weighs as much as the orange then that means that the orange weighs that much orange ma weighs as much as the object
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018 you first put in the orange and then you
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_023 i can not understand that
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_015 i can not understand that
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_009 if i knew the measu if i knew the weight of the other object and then i compared it with with the thing that you did not that he did not have a scale to measure then i would just see if they weighed the same with my with my two hands and then i would know
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_005 so we can find out the measurement of we can find out how what other stuff is i mean we can find out how how heavy stuff is
myst_999464_2009-09-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_006 grams are easier to understand
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 if it was hot or cold
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 it means that a is is a different temperature from c and c is a different temperature from b
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014 we want to use a thermometer because if we did not have one we would never know what the temperature was
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_015 i can not understand that
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013 what we what we did yesterday was we got a big we got a cup of water and then we put some ice in it and started stirring it and every minute we check checked the temperature but before we checked it we would stir the ice cubes but we would make sure that the ice cube was not to touching the thermometer
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011 i know that the temperature could be hot or cold and sometimes it can be freezing and sometimes it can be really really warm
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 the robot is sticking his finger in cup b to see if it is hot or cold
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_020 you would look closely and see what temperature it was
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027 i do not know
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012 you stick a thermometer in and then if then you see what it is
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026 you should look at all the numbers and see and if the alcohol goes up to fifty-five or just fifty then that would be how much the temperature is
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 in the water
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 which one was hotter and which one was colder
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 because if it was a really really hot day then you would want to know what temperature it was so but if because it might be too hot and you would not know
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_022 on some it is really hot and on some it is really cold
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_019 i am not sure
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_008 which one is hotter
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 you you look at it really closely once it is in the water and then if well if you had three cups then you would try to figure out if they weigh the same if they if they if they were were measured the same
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 the thermometer is
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_028 the the ice water i mean the ice it melts in the water and then it makes it and then the ice makes it colder
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_025 it is the alcohol
myst_999464_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 you could use a thermometer to measure the temperature or you could just use your finger
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_007 put the battery on top of the light bulb
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_030 it is not doing anything
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_021 when the light in the light bulb turns on it is because the energy circuit powers through the d cell to the light
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_022 i see electricity heating the light bulb and going through a circuit electricity is going through a circuit
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_006 they are wires
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_010 a battery is a source of energy
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_034 same thing as the other one
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_014 energy is a pathway that goes through the wires zero josh
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_029 the positive side the electricity flows through the positive side
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_036 one component can be connected to the the side of the bulb while the other is on the other side of the bulb and therefore it will light
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_018 light bulbs make the light turn on the wires and the the wires carry the electricity to power on light bulb
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_016 electricity and energy
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_015 the pathway of energy goes through the wires
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_026 the negative side
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_039 it went out because the bottom does not do anything the bottom of the light bulb has to be connected to the battery for it to flow it does not have a complete circuit
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_019 well the light bulb makes light and the wires carry the electricity the battery powers the light which the wires carry to the light bulb
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_024 electricity flows through a circuit that connects to
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_008 now you just hold it down and talk to marney for a long time she listens to everything you say and she tries to figure it out and see if you said something that is right wow so that can take time and normally they are
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_032 the flows go to the other side
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_028 electricity and energy flowing through the circuit
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_027 electricity flows toward the positive
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_031 the electricity flows to the opposite
myst_013001_2013-11-13_14-45-39_EE_1.1_023 it is going to the minus sign and it is going through the plus sign and it keeps rotating again
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_011 they are about measuring mass results in like sometimes seeing how much stuff weigh
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_006 to see how many grams to s see how many grams it is for the wood chip for the wood and the and the the metal chip
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020 there is not enough grams for for it to be the same mass of weight
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_026 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_004 it is about like twenty grams and yeah it is just about grams
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_016 it is a lot quicker because like ten it is just a lot quicker because instead of just putting seventy little one grams in it would get tiring and boring so you want to find out a quick strategy for like twenty and ten and all that kind of stuff to make it nice and quick
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_017 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_010 they are about measuring or weighing seeing how much something weighs if it is like you are seeing how much your object weighs in like a balance on like a balance
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_009 to see how many grams the object object that you are weighing is
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_027 you need to measure it twice maybe or maybe you like m miscounted or something
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_022 you weigh mass and stuff
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_023 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_029 i do not know i am not exactly sure
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_019 that it is a lot easier and quicker if you use bigger grams than just a small little like one grams
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_021 i think it is like a one hundred
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_008 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_002 i i can not really remember
myst_996712_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_013 that is just grams pretty much just like like five grams you could have a five gram or you could just have fifty-one grams and like ten gram 25s and just ten gram for like a twenty gram 210s just forty-five gram yeah
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_013 it was hard because we had to do it more than once because you had a a paper meter stick and you did not put it straight like you did not stretch it out to be straight it would be all loose and you would not get the exact height and we had to measure over and over again
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_002 of a person or what what
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_020 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_024 that his arms and his height are the exact same
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_023 none of them were the same for me at least maybe for other people some were the same
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_021 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_007 at the end of the desk
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_017 maybe a foot
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_014 we measured our arms our wrist to our elbow our foot and our height
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_006 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_018 you are using your pinkie for each centimeter
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_012 to make sure like you put it you have it straight not all like fat and folded or something like that
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_016 we did not measure our noses
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_025 i see that both of them are the same but my arm is bigger my arm my my wrist to my elbow is bigger than my foot or let me check
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_027 some are bigger than other body parts and some are smaller
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_005 most likely a meter stick
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_019 that it is a centimeter
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_026 they are the same size
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_010 what do you mean
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_030 you can use your thumb and your pinkie to measure ten centimeters
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_009 so you could put it on the ground you your classmate on the ground and you could measure their body like on their body not the side of them like on their body or use the wall and put on their body but not the side of them
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_011 zero some people when they measured people they they kind of made it they did not like so we have these little paper meter sticks and if you do not put it straight enough it is all loose and you do not get the exact height
myst_996712_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_004 i never said anything about that
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_035 me no know
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_028 i am not exactly sure
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_027 that the first one on the right is a one hundred celsius and the second one is fifty-five celsius
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_036 it turns it it was not what i thought it was aw a way different answer than i thou
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_005 which one is the hottest or which one is the coldest or one of those
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 that if it is hot or cold cause yeah if it is hot or cold
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_026 it turns into fahrenheit
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_018 getting the answer of celsius
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_040 it is not working
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_007 you feel different temperatures of celseite and fahrenheit celsius and fahrenheit
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_034 it turns cold
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_006 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_022 you look on the thermometer
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_017 it is about hot not cold i think i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_014 othing nothing really that i know of actually well i do not really know anything
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_002 i am not sh i forget
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008 i think it is a thermometer i can not remember the name but i think
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_039 that it is like counting by 10s like one billion, twenty million, three hundred and four thousand and fifty
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 you will not get the exact celseise celseise it will just be you will if you just stick stuck your finger in the water and it was cold you would just be like zero it is cold not exactly the exact celseise
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_019 cause that is the kind of tool you use in the unit temperature
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_025 that they are almost the same
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_024 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_031 that the second one is a lot colder than the first one
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_013 it will give you the exact answer well if you want to get a good answer you have to do it twice or something twice and look at it closely
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_038 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_009 to see fahrenheit and celsius
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_020 yeah just by looking at it kind of
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_033 i do not know act
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_006 so we like poured water into the cup and we like sucked it up with a syringe and squirted it in the graduated cylinder or something like that and saw how much it was
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_029 it has more capacity in
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_023 i can not really remember that
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_036 that they are it can be it can be the the maybe it could be the same but fatter or skinnier
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_017 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_025 that they are not the same
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_008 you pour it into cylinder vial thingy mama and like syringe stuff and stuff like that
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_016 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_022 i am not well just by look cause it shows on the syringe shows how much water how much volume you have in there
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_007 that it ended up being a one hundred and forty-two milliliters
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_021 you could just write that a b c d on a cup and actually i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_011 a graduated cylinder
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_032 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_004 so we estimated how much volume it would be so and then we like figured it out it was just it was kind of hard to explain
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_034 that they would be all different like kinds of volume measurement
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_027 just about the right amount of liquid
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_010 it shows how much milliliters that you have i guess
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_018 i do not know how you would do that
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_013 it is labeled it only is in 10s like one hundred and two quadrillion, thirty trillion, four hundred and five billion, sixty million, seven hundred and eight thousand and ninety a one hundred not like ones like in the syringe it shows like the ones like if you are at forty and there is little lines for the ones so you go like that is forty-two or something like that
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_037 that it is fatter but it is just the same mass of volume or yeah volume
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_024 that the first cup the first cup is bigger has more water than the second cup
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_038 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_003 it was it i can not remember
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_026 that it shows how much capacity you have
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_035 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_028 you should you would put water in it and you would get a syringe and suck it up with the syringe and then pour it out into another cup and keep on doing that until it is the water in the cup is all gone and you should be counting each time you do that cause fifty so like you suck it up that is fifty pour it out suck it up and then pour it out suck it up fif a one hundred and fifty pour it out that that is what i mean
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_002 we have been talking about millimeters and liters and syringe and like graduated cylinders and stuff like that
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_015 you measure wa well you measure milliliters and
myst_996712_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_031 i think it keeps full
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_022 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_024 one is heavier cause if it is heavier it leans if it is lighter it does not lean it stays up
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_015 just pick em up
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_011 they are the same size but it does not matter if they are the same size it depends of on how much it weighs
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_019 you could grab the other object or whatever you want to take and if it is light the other object is light and you know that the other one is heavy because you know how much it weighs not be how much you know it is
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010 that the plas the metal chip is obviously a lot heavier because it is metal it is made out of metal and it is heavier than the chip
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_023 the paper clip
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_009 it is not turning zero the metal one is more heavy because it is made out of metal the chip the plastic chip is a lot lighter cause it is made out of plastic and the wood is the lightest because it is light wood
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_016 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_035 you would have to use it because like the same size of paper clip cause if you use the like small and big then it would not make sense
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_029 we put like so if we were going to measure the plastic chip or the metal chip we would put it in the balance and then we would just put a bunch of pla pla paper clip and you would just keep on putting them until they were the same like same same
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_012 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_005 the metal one the metal chip should go first or did you mean lightest from heaviest or heaviest from lightest
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_034 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_007 the metal chip is heavier because it is metal plastic chip is lighter cause it is plastic and the wood is like the least heaviest because it is wood really like wood
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_030 that one of them is bigger and one of them is smaller
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_032 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_002 same as usual
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008 hello mine just like stopped right there
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_021 so if you have the plastic chip and there is you have to put more like one by one to see which one like one by one paper clip to see how they like if to so they are the same size same like it is all straight the
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_013 you could pu l you could put one in your hand and another in your other hand and like move your hands up and down and see how much they weigh like that or you can just see how much they weigh just by looking at it
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_041 cause sometimes gram pieces help more because there is like five grams if you want like instead of just putting five paper clips it uses five or ten instead of using ten paper clips you could just put ten grams
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_042 goodbye i have to go shut up
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_033 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_020 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_025 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_027 you put paper clips in the balance to see like how many paper clips the chi the metal or plastic chip would weigh
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_026 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_039 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_014 you put like one in your hand and the other in your hand and you put em like up and down like to see which one is heavier like
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_026 get better and better
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_013 you could you could you use your your pinkie and your thumb to do ten centimeters
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_027 cause you do it over and over again
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_014 i do not know what you mean
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_025 so you can memorize it maybe or you just can get an accurate score like you can just like to get it exactly how long how long it is or whatever
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_022 you can look at it with your hand like if you put your pinkie out that is a centimeter so like you could count centimeters
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_021 i do not know
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_030 in our class we like estimate so w we found an object in the room and we estimated how long it was and then we measured it to see how long it really was
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_024 to make sure it is accurate and like exact
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_008 what do you mean
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_020 it is a meter
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_004 you measure things like big things like let us say you want to measure a pencil it would not be a good size you wo want to measure a foot if you are going to measure a pencil
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_019 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_007 they are all like meter at the end like millimeter centimeter meter and and like yeah
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_016 by looking at your object and seeing just with your eyes to see like maybe how long it is or depends what you want to estimate on
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_005 i think my friend nick is maybe a meter i think
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_017 you spread your hand apart with your pinkie and your thumb
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_010 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_023 i am not exactly sure
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_002 i do not really remember
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_031 like maybe if you go to the bank and you need to know how big a dollar how long a dollar is or maybe like that you could use your pinkie to your pinkie to see how much centimeters is it is
myst_996712_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_006 to the it it it is like the doorknob from a door yeah nick is really short
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_011 i am not zero group two is more is less amount or yeah less amount of volume in group four is more amount i think
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_001 i am doing great
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_033 t it is a syringe with water in it and it has got to squeeze out water
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_018 pouring it into a different cup like drops little drops
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_005 i am not exactly sure
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_017 it means that like they are small i think and they are like it is a good tool that you should use
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_037 it represents the millimeters that that is on the syringe
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_036 look at this you would look at the syringe cause it shows on the syringe
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_031 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_035 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_002 i do not really remember as usual
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_016 it is way too much and less you are going to have like a really big bowl or like something like really big that can hold a gallon or something
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_029 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_015 the water in the cup well the volume the volume in the cup
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_025 they are seeing how much milliliters you of water in your cup
myst_996712_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_008 that there is nothing inside of them
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_019 i do not know what you mean
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_006 yes i do
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_013 like if you told me how long is the width i would mether measure the width and how long is the length i would mether measure the length
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_018 we had to measure the length and also measure the width and my teacher tricked us because she cut straws made em shorter so it was hard
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_004 i did it
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_015 just forget about the desk and let us say there was a triangle a long triangle and with the length you could measure how long it is with the skinny part
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_022 i am confused a little bit
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_020 zero you if you used those straws to measure your desk it would not work because they are both different sizes and you need the same sizes to measure your desk
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_016 in class we used straws which was kind of hard
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_012 how long it is
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_010 it is about measuring different things
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_011 it is about measuring things
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_014 so let us say there was a desk and it was like a triangle i would not do it with the fat way i would do it with the skinny way that would be the width of the triangle i mean the length of the triangle
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017 zero you set the straw down in the middle for the length and then put your finger at the end and then move it over your finger and then put your finger at the end and over your finger and you have to find out how many straws your desk is
myst_996712_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_024 marty i have to go
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_008 at the beginning it is pretty it is pretty warm not actually that warm at all but then it goes down and it starts to get cold
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_038 that it is d different temperatures in each one
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 that it goes from hot down to cold and then co keeps still cold and then kind of medium warmish again
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_031 if you look at it the thermometer or the number line
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 that it is going pretty pretty well kind of cold from cold to hot yeah actually from hot to cold and then medium again
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_039 the water is getting hotter and colder
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_019 the information from the other chart that we actually used to write on
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_017 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 sometimes they they can freeze if it is too cold if you leave it out in like snow sometimes it is it just stays cold like but it warms up if you just leave it there and yeah
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 for us like cause we have table groups in our table group it just stayed at the same temperature so first it went to sixteen then to eight then to five and then to five again five hundred and fifty-five and then six and then five thousand, five hundred and fifty-five and it was stayed at five mostly the whole time
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_028 you could estimate or stick your finger in or something like that
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 it did not change
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_036 looking at by looking at the thermometer
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 it changes temperature
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_022 temperature and minutes that it is from
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026 the temp the temperature went down and changed the degree celsius
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013 one to twenty-one with like up and sideways it was like one to sixteen and those are like the minutes and stuff like that
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_030 ure by looking at the thermometer and guess well you well just yeah by just by looking at it
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_035 a thermometer tells you the temperature changed
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027 pretty long i think
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 it changes like if you wave your hand it changes i think i am not sure like cause the wind is blowing on it like air is in the way so you ch
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 it changed to cold at the end it changed to cold well when we first put it it changed it was going down the thermometer was going down
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014 that it goes from from s from five to six to nine and then to thirteen
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011 by looking at the thermometer maybe
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_002 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 by looking at the
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_037 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_032 that it turns cold to it turns pretty cold and it goes down to degrees celsise
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012 i am not sure
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_034 the first one the first one yeah
myst_996712_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_010 the thermometer goes down i guess
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_012 you put the mass pieces the little grams in the cup in the other cup and just weigh just keep on putting em until it is even
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009 we me we seed how much mass weight it was in the classroom and in for one of the things that we did we just put water in no sponge or actually no that did not happen
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_016 if you do not know or if you do know
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_021 it was it was
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_014 and then for the kind of dry one i thought it just really surprised me that my my my answers were answered and they were like all wrong wrong yeah
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_002 i do not really remember
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_011 it is just a dry sponge just a dry sponge in a cup heavier than nothing
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_007 the sponge is just the middle one is just wet not exactly soaked so it is like thirty grams it is like thirty grams from what i remember yeah so the dry one is two or two or three the wet one is thirty and the soaked one is sixty
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_013 we just yeah you just put in whatever object you want to put in the first cup put little grams in the other cup for for that
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004 that we were measuring them we were seeing how much mass grams they were in class
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_015 i found out that like if you use bigger grams it is a lot faster and easier for you to for you to figure out the mass weight of the grams and and it is quicker and he and it helps me helps you
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_003 it is sponges dry wet and soaked
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008 it is not too wet it is just dipped in the water a little bit it is just a little bit wet not exactly water all soaked up in it
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_006 it is dry and hard and not really like it is not too heavy it is like one hundred and twenty-three grams something some yeah two or three grams
myst_996712_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005 a soaked sponge is really heavy
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_006 it turned to gas
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_014 the gas creates mass also so when the bag is open it lets the gas out causing it to be less mass the closed bag creates more mass because the air is trapped in
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_013 they always keep the same mass
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_007 the molecules are different
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_004 the solute made the reactant react
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_009 i see water baking soda and calcium chloride
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_008 and the baking soda and the calcium chloride the baking soda has is denser than the calcium chloride
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_010 the molecules took and rearranged themselves to create a new product
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_003 there was a chemical reaction and and then the two different substances mixed together to create a chemical reaction which called salt
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_005 the solution in the bag caused a reaction that shows that there was c zero or carbon dioxide in the bag
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_012 when you put together two reactants that weigh different amounts of mass then it will weigh the amount of mass with the then the product will weigh the amount of mass that the two reactants weigh together
myst_014031_2014-02-11_12-28-35_MX_4.2_015 because the gas actually creates mass with the bag closed that means that the mass from the air gets trapped in with the open bag then the mass from the air travels into the actual air
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_004 they are solids
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_022 the salt dissolved
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_018 the sand got caught in the separator and the water went straight through
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_015 the marbles stay on top of the strainer and the water goes through
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_014 they separate into different pieces
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_024 marni i do not know
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_013 i do not know marni
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_020 i need help
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_012 marni they separate her name is marni like siri but it is marni they separate
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_005 all these things are mixtures
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_008 the one on the left is a mixture
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_026 the salt will get dissolved
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_016 the marbles and the water separate
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_021 the salad mixes together whereas the paper clips and wood chips do not
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_003 i do not know
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_017 well the marbles are on top of the strainer and the water went through
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_023 that is called a solution
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_019 the mixture is separated
myst_014031_2013-12-12_12-33-19_MX_1.1_006 water and marbles water is a or is a liquid and marbles are a solid
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_011 citric acid is the one on the bottom epsom salt is the one on the top left and salt is the one on the far right
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_008 some dissolve more in more in water because they are more soluble
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_009 the water gains mass because of the salt that is going into it
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_012 you let the water evaporate
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_006 sugar is two more scoops soluble than four than citric acid
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_013 i think it is epsom salt
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_004 it took four scoops for the water to complete be completely saturated with the citric acid and six scoops to be
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_015 i think they are made of epsom salt
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_010 it is substance three
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-39-14_MX_3.2_003 we have been trying to figure out the different trying to work zero we have been figuring out
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_018 it tastes a lot more like water
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_022 if you have more water in one it will give the little grape fantastic particles more space and if you do the one hundred and fifty milliliter water with four spoonfuls it will taste a lot more like the grape fantastic
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_019 you can add more or less water but keep the same amount as grape fantastic stuff
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_017 it would taste a lot more like water than the grape flavoring
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_021 by adding more or less water
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_010 the darker the color the more concentrated it is
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_009 we looked at the colors
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_008 could you repeat that marni
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_012 the darker colored solutions are more concentrated
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_011 the darker has more powder and the lighter has less powder or
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_020 adding more and less water to the cups
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_014 it has more water and less powder
myst_014031_2014-01-09_12-28-44_MX_2.1_007 one has more concentration than the other
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_004 they were mixing the sand and water to make a
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_039 the water and the salt and water solution dissolved
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_017 they always keep the same mass
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_013 it is water and it helps the the salt
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_030 the salt dissolves
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_005 the salt and water mixture dissolve
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_015 if we add the like the candy that is ten grams and the raisins that is twenty grams and the peanuts that are twenty grams it will make fifty grams because ten twenty twenty is
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_011 they have different property
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_012 the solute is the salt the salt will dissolve
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_020 it gets heavy
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_016 the salts and the water is mixed together creating the mass of the salt and water
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_043 you can evaporate the water to get the ice crystals back
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_042 it helps separate the dissolved items from the solute solvent
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_007 she is on a solution
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_038 use the different properties for an advantage
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_044 the salt crystals are left it is important because you can
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_018 they keep the same
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_025 you use different materials based on the different types of properties the things have
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_021 when the salt which is fifteen grams and the water which is fifty grams are mixed together they create sixty-five grams of salt water
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_048 you can not separate the solute from the solvent in a solution unless you evaporate the salt
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_002 we have been learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_022 they keep the same mass
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_029 the salt dissolved in the water and the water went completely through
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_045 the water evaporates and the salt crystals are left
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_023 the water and the salt mixed together is sixty-five grams or as the salt is fifteen grams separate and the water alone is fifty gram
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_019 they have the same property
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_035 there was no mix there is no mixture in the solution
myst_014031_2013-12-17_12-31-00_MX_1.2_026 at first they mix the water and the flour together then they used a coffee filter and something to hold up the coffee filter poured the water and flour in and the water went through the coffee filter
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_007 i do not know
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_013 the sugar is more soluble than the epsom salt which means more sugar can dissolve in the
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_016 the salt adds more mass
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_015 because the salt is added to the fifty milliliters of water it adds more mass to the water which means it is more than fifty milliliters of water
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_011 the water becomes fully saturated which means no more it can not hold anymore salt
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_002 mixtures and solution
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_014 is no longer soluble
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_005 it is salt and water mixed together
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_012 the solution is no longer soluble
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_006 it is saturated fully saturated
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_010 after three scoops of epsom salt the water becomes fully saturated and no more salt can dissolve
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_008 the more salt you add the more water like the higher the water get
myst_014031_2014-01-30_12-29-59_MX_3.1_017 you kept adding grams until the and well so first you put the solution and the grams into the
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-21-29_MX_4.1_010 a solution i said that
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-21-29_MX_4.1_009 a reaction from the vinegar and the baking soda and it created bubbles that goes up and up and up and up until the world ends by the way if any scientists are hearing this i have a weird imagination so yeah
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-21-29_MX_4.1_012 mixtures of of kyle help me out here
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-21-29_MX_4.1_007 a reaction called a a or a solution
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-21-29_MX_4.1_004 the chemicals of baking soda and vinegar mixed and it created a chemical that made a reaction to make it fizz
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-36-58_MX_4.2_004 a reactant is is the amount of baking soda and calcium chloride that is added to the bag
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-36-58_MX_4.2_005 air is inside the bag and the water is so clear you hardly can see it
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-36-58_MX_4.2_002 sky does mine craft
myst_014032_2014-02-10_13-36-58_MX_4.2_003 the salt is being added with water which dissolves into i mean wait what is that
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_002 good how are you
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_004 it is mixing into when you add sand with the water it turns brown when you add the water with the salt it dissolves the salt not the water that would be creepy huh
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_015 my ignorant friend cade over there is just being an ignorant
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_016 are you fat
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_017 do you think cade needs to take a bath
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_007 the salt dissolved and it is important because cause it disappears dissolving means disappearing
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_013 think about it one more time huh
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_019 it is dark in here i am scared
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_010 what no she will not respond to that she is only a prototype anyway sorry about that marni it is just my ignorant friend cooper there would you like to respond to that marni
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_018 that the grams that that the water is it is fifty grams on the water fifteen grams on the salt you add that together well it would be sixty-five grams of water and salt that and the salt dissolved so that is how i know marni now shut yo yaps shut yo get get yo butt over here
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_008 attempting to make the water different
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-50-04_MX_1.2_009 could you repeat that marni
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-39-15_MX_2.1_003 a mixture is being made there is a dark and a light the light tastes like water and the dark tastes like grape
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-39-15_MX_2.1_009 the light cup has twenty-five grams and the dark cup has seventy-five grams
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-39-15_MX_2.1_008 one is dark and one is light
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-39-15_MX_2.1_013 excuse me could you repeat that
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-39-15_MX_2.1_011 one is purple and the other one is purple
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-39-15_MX_2.1_010 light and one is dark
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-39-15_MX_2.1_007 i do not know marni please repeat that
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_011 it means you have no friends
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_003 good how are you
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_018 sorry you are not my type i think cade is more of your type cause he is also computer program with no friends or family alright yes he does have a family but he has no friends and no girl will never go out with him except for you you ugly beep
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_015 we wish you a merry christmas
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_017 they float to the top and the concentrated solution b sinks to the bottom
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_021 it will float to the top
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_016 i say you should jump into that cup and drown yourself you are ugly
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_006 sorry marni we have not gotten that far in mixtures and solutions effraim stop talking we have not gotten that do not do that anyway we have not gotten that far in mixtures and solutions
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_001 good cade still does not have a girl friend obviously and you are still weird
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_020 i am a fifteen year old girl in cyber
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_004 show me an animation
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_027 the blue is more dense cause it has more grams and the green is is the least of dense as two grams
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_010 i do not know well you are here well actually the penny is is more dense than the cork which makes the cork float so the penny sinks
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_013 one would sink to the bottom
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_025 cause solution b goes to the bottom where solution a is so they mix together to make fifty milliliters of water of salt solution
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_022 i just gave you the answer respond back tell me i am right sucker guys say something yell something
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_002 we were doing we were learning about rainbows in a tube
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_023 they all mix so now it is one big solution b
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_024 the more dense solution
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-54-16_MX_2.4_012 the the solution a is more dense than solution b
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_002 good how are you
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_018 stop repeating everything you say stop kicking me in the marbles not marni i am confused
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_007 salad and water
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_025 all i see is dark marni can you please not make it so dark you creepy face mustache lady with a weird i can not even see your body i do not want your head anymore you are ugly
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_030 when you add the salt to the water it will dissolve
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_029 creepy i what is it called sorry marni i do not know
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_019 why is this even important marni please explain to me and you have a chick stash you look so weird
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_028 could you repeat that marni
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_027 today is going to be a wonderful day cause i got in the shower first
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_033 no cause it it formed with the water so it is one big glass of grape juice i guess i do not know
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_011 they are all mixtures of something like trail mix is a mixture of peanuts raisins and m ms thanks marni
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_012 i do not care
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_016 well when you have a pan with tiny little holes that are not big enough for the marbles only the water will flow through it so the marbles will stay on the pan
myst_014032_2013-12-13_12-33-03_MX_1.1_020 okay well when you pour the water into the cloth it the water will flow through the thing through the cloth and go into the other cup that is what is in the animation marni or should i say ugly
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-28-40_MX_3.1_016 you are trying to
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-28-40_MX_3.1_007 we are learning on dissolving where is it coming from
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-28-40_MX_3.1_010 it is being dissolved into the water but also it does not dissolve cause there are still salt particles left
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-28-40_MX_3.1_008 you are dissolving it
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-28-40_MX_3.1_018 you have to mix the salt solution with the fifty milliliters of water dang it marni you interrupted my session
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-28-40_MX_3.1_012 scientists that are listening to me right now well let us just say the i put in the pink jack and she does not listen to me can you hear me cause if you can i would really appreciate if josh came here and fixed it
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-28-40_MX_3.1_009 marni i am sorry but my friends are complaining what is your deal
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_026 i do not know why is there a clock
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_021 i do not care
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_024 cause the filter only lets water come through it and not gravel
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_023 you are separating the gravel from the water
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_020 because the paper clips are made of metal and the magnets pick up
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_025 i do not care please let me live i am begging you why are you saying malfunction
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_008 what is a sieve
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_006 well only the water and dirt from the rocks flows through the from the flows through the panel but the rocks do not
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_017 cause you can not use water because there is no water in the jar marni
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_009 it is kinda dark marni so can you please show me an animation
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_013 magnetism i said that already gosh
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_016 the rocks from the water
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_005 gravel tooth picks and and paper clips you use the magnets to separate the paper clips from the gravel and tooth picks
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_018 here getting some gas from marni cause i am hearing the word what what are you guys on
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_002 hey there marni
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_007 the properties of i do not care
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-29-54_MX_1.3_019 you use the magnet to separate the paper
myst_014032_2014-01-17_12-53-02_MX_2.2_001 good kade can not get a girl friend as usual and i think he is gaining weight
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_014 it is being added into trail mix
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_010 marni hi how are you today the grapetastic or whatever it is called needs to be added to the megan stop it
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_008 you are creepy
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_013 ricky john jones ricky john jones ricky john john john john john
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_019 it is evaporated into solution
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_002 marie i am awake and healthy
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_011 you add the salt to the water and it makes erosion
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_012 screen looks like a pack of eggs
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_009 add the grape to the water marni i am not stupid
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_018 well ten grams twenty grams plus another twenty grams equals fifty grams i am sorry marni that was my ignorant friend cade
myst_014032_2013-12-20_13-21-33_MX_1.2_003 why should i you are nothing but a computer program you do not know nothing sucker
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_012 my friend cade thinks you are hot
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_014 there is more grams of grape grape mixture in the third glass
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_013 is cade horrible at mine craft
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_003 evaporation and mixture
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_005 yes a feather weighs two ounces and a rock weighs three
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_001 i am good how are you today marni
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_011 my prediction was correct marni because it is cause the twenty grams is heavier than the ten grams the twenty grams adds to the water which makes it seventy which makes it ninety-five grams and the and the and the ten grams makes it eighty-five grams
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_007 ninety grams is heavier than two grams
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_009 the twenty grams the twenty grams will be heavier because twenty is bigger than ten for
myst_014032_2014-01-10_12-45-06_MX_2.2_015 hey marni are you great at mine craft cause i know not
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-41-03_MX_3.2_009 the mass of the weights is less is different than the others
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-41-03_MX_3.2_006 the sugar weighs more than the citric acid and the
myst_014032_2014-01-31_12-41-03_MX_3.2_007 the citric acid is weighs seventy-six i mean sixty-seven grams and the four and the epsom salt weighs forty and the sugar weighs grams
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_019 they are yellow
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_007 i can see a light bulb
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_011 i will tell you that i could tell you that the light uhm bounces off the blue ball as blue light
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_003 uhm they are all bright
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_013 uhm i do not know zero the blue ball is filtering blue light out of the white light
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_006 i think it can come from light bulbs and overhead light
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_017 the light is reflecting off the ball is yellow light because the ball is reflecting the yellow light out of the white
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_008 the light is uhm the white light is going through a prism and being broken apart into the colors of the rainbow
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_014 it is bouncing off of the ball is blue
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_002 we have been talking about light
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_012 the light ray hitting the ball stays as white light the light ray reflecting off wait the light ray hitting the ball is white light the light reflecting off the ball is blue light
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_018 light rays that are hitting the ball are white the light rays reflecting off of the ball are yellow
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_016 the light is getting filtered into yellow light
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_001 i am doing good thank you
myst_012220_2015-01-26_10-27-35_EE_5.2_009 prism breaks up the light into all the colors of the rainbow
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_004 the north and south sides of the magnet are sticking
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_012 a grow hiking north
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_007 sides north and north south and south repel but north and south attract
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_008 the sides because north and north is facing because north is facing north and it is repelling and south is facing facing south and it is repelling
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_006 because sides north and north repel but sides north and south attract
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_005 they would repel because sides north and north repel or south and south repel but this these are sides north and south
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_013 i do not know it is it is pointing north
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_003 north and south north and south stick together but north and north repellent south and south repellent
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_009 the sides north and south are attracting or south and north are attracting
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_002 we have been learning about magnets
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-30-29_EE_3.2_010 the two bottom magnets are attracting because their sides north and north or south and south but on the i mean the two bottom magnets are attracting because they are either because they are north and south both on that the there is repelling because it is north and north or south and south
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_015 there is an electronic force around the wrapped wire
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_014 it starts becoming a magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_007 getting the revit to act like a magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_010 a closed circuit
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_019 the rivet becomes a magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_008 you rapid around the revit as many times as you can
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_018 ah you know need a lot of electricity
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_016 the wire has to be wrapped around the rivet ah a wire for it to become a magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_021 it has to be next to the rivet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_003 the sides north and south on a magnet attract sides north and north repel and south and south repel
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_002 learning about magnets
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_020 it opens or closes the
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_005 i do not know
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_011 it makes the rivet become a magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_009 there is a switch and there is really long wire that wraps around the revit like ah a wire
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_006 because if it is in no electricity will go through the revit and it will not be able to become a magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_004 these are the materials on how to make a steel revit become a magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_10-05-29_EE_4.1_012 it becomes a magnet
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_015 the switch needs be close
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_010 this is a motor with a switch a circuit without switch
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_012 the motor is spinning
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_024 the the flag starts spinning again
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_021 that the sun is there to produce energy
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_027 it is a circuit with a motor
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_017 i was absent that day
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_003 the energy is coming out of the negative side to the motor motor making it span and then come and it is a going attracted to the positive side
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_025 it produces energy so the solar panels can get energy for the motor
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_013 because the switch was in touching the wire
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_014 it stops because it can flows to the part to the positive side
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_004 because the motor is getting powered by the d cell in the motor is powering the flag
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_009 it gives the motor power so the flag can run
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_007 the motor is getting powered by the d cell
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_005 that there is power in the motor it has ended
myst_007082_2014-02-11_13-08-24_EE_1.2_006 the d cell has to get energy not the motor has to get energy from the d cell for the flag to move
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_022 it breaks up the force a little
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_012 the distance is going
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_006 on the left side there is two magnets and on the right side there is a bunch of washers
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_005 it s checking how many washers they can take into the magnetic force between two magnets is broken up
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_015 the magnetic force
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_010 when i add a spacer the earlier be the distance between the two magnets goes and it is harder to keep the same amount of force
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_007 when i add more washers this
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_019 you put more spacers
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_003 the magnet is attracting the magnetic force is attracting the paper clip and when the magnet moves the paper clip moves with
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_001 not really good
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_016 it breaks up the force little bit but if you have enough spacers and you could pull one washer and it would and one washer would break up the whole force
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_021 it becomes smaller
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_011 it breaks up the force a little bit
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_008 the force is strong
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_013 when i add a washer the force breaks up because the spacers there is so much little there is so little like there is so little force left that just one spacer could break up breaks up the whole thing
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_009 the force is really strong
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_014 it breaks it breaks up the force
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_020 the magnetic force gets gets easier to break every time you add a spacer
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-54-01_EE_3.4_017 the force is in strong enough so even one washer could break up the whole ah the whole force between the two magnets
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_017 the nail on the left doesn t stick to the magnet because it does not have it does not have iron or steel inside of it
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_014 the wood block does not have any iron or steel inside of it
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_027 because it has iron or steel inside of
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_015 are they stick to made of iron or steel
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_020 the stuff that has iron or steel in it its sticks with the stars does that is not have iron or steel in it
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_021 it will not stick because it does not have iron or steel in
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_004 the sides north and south attract
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_029 well we have talked about what sticks to magnets and that is iron struck with iron and steel inside of it
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_016 the alert nail on the side is an alumina aluminum nail that does not stick to magnets
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_002 we ve been learning about magnets
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_011 yes there is iron or steel in the nail
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_007 the three magnets are sticking to the fridge
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_010 there is iron or steel in the nail
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_019 the one that is made of steel
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_003 there is a north and south sides of magnets and north and south attract both north and north repel and south and south repel
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_012 wood does not have iron or steel in it but the nail has iron or steel in it
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_006 i learn that in class that iron or steel attract magnets
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_028 iron or steel
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_024 some metals have iron in them or steel and those was stick to magnets
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_013 irons are all made out of steel and iron
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_025 it will stick
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_009 the steel nail is sticking to the magnet the
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_023 it might have iron or steel in it and that is
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_008 there is iron and steel in the refrigerator
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-20-23_EE_3.1_018 one nail has iron or steel in it the other nail does not have iron or steel
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_007 each light bulb has its own path way
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_012 in a series circuit yeah yeah the light bulb doesn t have light bulbs doesn t shine brightly because it s sharing a pathway from the d cell
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_015 it is showing what pathway it s going
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_014 repeat that please
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_016 it look like it s going from the negative side to the or to the light bulb and back to the positive side of the d cell
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_023 because the bottom one is a parallels parallel i mean series circuit are the top one the second top one is the parallel circuit and the other top one is just one light bulb so it has a in order so it has a lot of power energy
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_010 the light bulbs on the top are really bright light bulbs on the bottom aren t so bright because are on the top they each have every light bulb had its own path way but on the bottom the light bulb sure their own pathway
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_011 the light bulbs was shine brighter
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_009 there lighting out freely brightly because i think they each have their own zero what do you path way
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_013 we ve been working it was series and parallel circuits
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_008 each light bulb has its own path way
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_019 the white bulb the white bulbs are brighter and they last longer
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_002 we ve been learning about how magnets attracts and repel each other
myst_007082_2014-03-20_12-44-22_EE_2.2_022 light bulbs are on the topper brighter than the light bulbs on the bottom
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_017 i couldn t move my items so
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_007 the electric current is flowing through the paper clip
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_016 the motor won t spin because the electricity can t flows to it is in a complete circuit if it don t have a conductor
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_018 they love it they let electricity flows to be them so it can going go to the battery and then
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_019 they are metal
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_008 the electricity is flowing through the motor and then it s going back into the d cell and it close to around in everything
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_004 how electricity can flow through something it s put not other
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_015 insulators they stops the electric flow of the electric flow of energy but conductors they let a flows through
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_003 the energy from the d cell is flowing through the motor and then it s going to the nail and then touching the switch and back and back to the d cell
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_012 it is opened
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_009 the energy is going through the negative side of the back of the d cell and then going through the motor which makes it spin now it s going through the paper clip to the switch and then it s able to flow back to the d cell
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_010 some of the stuff in the list works put others don t like the sponge and the wax
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_014 the stick is in insulator so the energy stops flowing
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_011 that with a stick the motor won t move the motor won t spin
myst_007082_2014-02-24_13-11-24_EE_1.3_005 the electricity flows to every single part of the circuit
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_022 it goes back to what wish normally at the electricity flow back to aside they were going to the in the first
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_013 i see the battery powering one end one wire and it s going to touching the light bulb at this side and then it s going to end and coming out through another wire and it goes a round and round
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_020 it looks like it s flowing through the positive it s like its attracted to the positive but then it goes out and it just keeps going around in a circle
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_005 its stores energy and then it gives other things energy to use
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_021 if you click the d cell the battery turns around and then the little blue dots attract back to the positive
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_017 well like electricity is flowing toward the positive end
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_012 i think it means that they receive energy from the wires or the battery
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_011 well the lit the wires carry electricity from the batteries and they power the filament and the light bulb
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_026 it goes out through the negative touch
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_025 the wire is touching one side one end of the wire is touching the battery the other end is touching the side of the light bulb and then on the other side of the wire is touching the battery and touching the bottom of the light bulb
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_010 light bulbs are they hold the filament and the wires power of the filament
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_024 negative its flowing away from the negative side and going to the positive side because it is attracted to the positive side
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_015 it goes out through the and comes back in to the positive
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_029 the sides the sides work
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_014 the electricity is flowing in one way and going to the light bulb and out the other end coming out to the bottom and then going to the other end of the d cell and it s going around and around
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_028 they would not work it would not flow like it is suppose to
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_006 they they need to be connect touching the battery and then one end of the wire at the bottom touching the bottom of the light bulb and then the other one is side
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_018 it goes towards the positive side and out the negative
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_002 learning how to make a light bulb light
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_003 a light bulb two wires and a battery
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_004 they powers stuff like computers and stuff like that
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_009 i don t know
myst_007082_2014-02-04_12-47-45_EE_1.1_030 they light up and i think it because the wire have to be in certain position for you to light up
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_023 the other light bulbs still keeps giving light
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_025 the filament it burns out but the light bulb the other light bulb soaked
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_016 the light bulb burned out
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_021 a series i mean a parallel circuit
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_029 the filament burnt out but the other light bulb is sliding because it s a series circuit and there is only one path way of energy
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_002 we ve been learning about magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_012 the light bulb burned out and now the here is no pathway
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_024 one filament broke but the other light bulbs are still working
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_022 the other light bulbs keeps sliding
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_017 the light bulb burned out
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_006 when the switch is closed the light bulb works but when it s open it doesn t
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_008 a parallel circuit works better than a normal circuit because in a parallel circuit each light bulb has its own path
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_010 the other light bulb doesn t work because it s not connected
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_026 they all connect to the d cell
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_018 the light bulb burns out
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_004 there are the energy goes to the negative side of the d cell goes through the light bulb then to the switch and then to the d cell again
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_020 it s a circuit where each light bulb has its own pathway so even if one burns out the other will store keep giving light
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_003 need to they need a parallel circuit to work
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-09-48_EE_2.3_009 there is only one pathway of energy
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_019 at the top of the nail
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_012 on a thin tackle paper because it is so thin if the magnet can reach the paper clip the magnetic force but in a tackle paper it can
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_022 are the nail would lose its force
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_003 the sides north and south on a magnet attracts but north and north and south and south repel
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_004 the sides north and south attract
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_024 all the magnets touching the nail and the nail is becoming a magnet which is picking up the paper
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_014 it gets further and the magnetic force can it can like it does not have that much power so it can so the magnetic force can travel through that much
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_025 it s becoming a temporary magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_030 are the magnet is taken off and then the paper clip in the nail there is no more magnetic force
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_026 i do not know
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_008 there is a magnet magnetic force and they are trying to attract but the table is stopping if and getting all the way there
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_005 sides north and south attracts but north and north repel and south and south repel
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_006 the the magnet on the bottom on the bottom is moving the magnet on the top because there is sticking
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_021 it helps them nails get on magnetic force to pick up the paper clip
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_029 the nail is becoming a temporarily a magnet and it is picking up the paper clip
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_011 there is not enough force to reach the paper clip so it can move the paper clip
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_016 all the magnetic force is traveling into the nail and it is making it acts like an
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_017 the magnet makes the nails stick like a magnet so the paper clip can stick to the nail
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_031 because there is no magnetic force
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_028 it s the same thing
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_020 because it is a different force the magnetic force travels to the nail and picks up the paper
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_002 learning about magnet
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_018 the magnet needs to be a really strong
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_007 there is something in between them but the magnet is so strong that it is pulling the magnet on top and it is attracting it
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_034 the magnet is giving the the nail a magnetic force and it is picking up the paper
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_009 i actually tried once putting a magnet under a table and them put another magnet on top and trying to move it around the bottom magnet and the top magnet moves to
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_027 it is acting like a magnet because a magnet is touching it and then it has a magnetic force
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_010 the paper is really thin so the magnetic force doesn t have to travel far to reach the paper clip and it is sticks to the magnets so when the magnet move the paper clip moves with it
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_033 if it is touching if a magnet is touching something that thing can become temporary
myst_007082_2014-04-24_09-36-18_EE_3.3_013 if the magnet is not very powerful it will not be able to the magnetic force will not be able to reach the paper clips so the paper can clip can move with the with the magnet
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_006 well the material that makes the conductor if you just made it out of plain metal it will not work but if you put the iron in it it will work
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_002 we have been learning about conductors and insulators
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_020 they are covered with plastic
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_007 if you have a switch and it is closed and you put a conductor and attach it to the other side of the switch the switch will start the switch will start working and the motor or light bulb will go on
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_011 when the straw is trying to did what the conductor does it does not work because it is not a closed circuit it is still open
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_005 all the conductors are made from metal
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_008 when the nail touches the conductor well when the nail is the conductor and it touches the switch in the end of the wire it makes the motor spin around
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_021 because a wire is like a conducer because it is made out of iron like a nail or paper clip so that it can conduct electricity
myst_997480_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004 a nail can make the motor spin if you attach it to the wire and then to the l switch it will make the motor s
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_017 the electricity is flowing through the negative through the light bulbs and down into the positive
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_005 i see a parallel circuit
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015 the blue dots are the electricity flowing through the wires lighting up the light bulb and going back through the d cell lighting up the light bulbs and etc etc
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_006 the wires are letting one wire is letting the d cell flow through throw through one hi one light bulb lighted up and then come back to the d cell then the other energies take off go through light up the other light bulb and come back to the d cell
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018 goes back in the d cell on the positive side and then it comes through the positive side and goes back down to the and repeats that over and over again
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_004 the d cell is letting energy through both wires so that it lets both light bulbs light up with the same amount of energy
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_008 it has two light bulbs and one battery the other ones that we have had have two light bulbs and one battery but they are not parallel
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_016 that it is going through the d cell coming out of the other end lighting up the light bulb with the electricity is actually just going through a thin a thin wire and the light bulb then going back through the d cell and repeating that just over and over again
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011 there is one pathway for each light bulb so that it lights it up more than other circuits because they are sharing the electricity and that is it is just one big circuit than this is just two little circuits
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_030 that if it is through a parallel circuit it is a lot brighter like in our house we have so many parallel circuits
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019 one is the battery and two are the light bulbs
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014 it is going through one end of the d cell lighting up the bulb and then coming back through the d cell lighting bulbs up again and then going and then just repeating that over and over and over again
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003 we have been learning about circuits
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_009 the parallel they are not sharing the electricity whether the other circuit they are sh sharing the electricity
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_022 i see on the left there is a non parallel and i see on the right there is
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_032 that it is mostly parallel circuit
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_007 there is one d cell and two bulbs
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_026 well it is interesting because everything in a house has electricity and so it is interesting to learn about how electricity throw f flows through my house and stuff like that like i went home and i opened up my circuit box and my dad showed me a place in our wall were there is not any walling and i got to see all the wires
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_012 that parallel circuits have only one path no twenty-two pathways each light bulb has one pathway
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_013 they are just two little circuits combined
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_027 i think we have parallels because in our house it is not as dim as well it is not as dim as one circuit but it is as it is lighter than that circuit but it is the same circuit so i am not sure how that works
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_010 the parallel circuit they are not sharing so that they light up than the other one they are sharing the electricity so they do not light up as bright
myst_997480_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_031 well since our light are still lit up like in our downstairs they are really light because in one room it is where the electricity starts in our house and lights it up a lot bright brighter than anywhere else
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_029 well as you said think about the circuit it is right because the the conducing arms are attached to the wires and that is a closed circuit
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_003 there is one battery wires and a light bulb
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002 well we have been learning about how to put wires on a m not mag a battery and then try to make a light bulb light up
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_005 cells are ninety-nine are nine volt batteries and you can attach wires to them to make a light bulb m light up
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_006 it lets the wires get energy so that when it attaches to the light it can light up because of all the power that is going through the wires
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_026 positive side of the d cell
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_027 it is the same thing that happened in the last circuit though the electricity is still coming but you cannot see that
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_010 the bulb shows you if you are doing it right with the wires and the battery because if you are not doing it right you might shock yourself
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_021 it is right and the rest of them are not
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_025 the electricity is coming out of the negative going up through the conducing arms and coming right back out into the
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_013 the green areas by off the electricity that is inside of the d cell and on one side on the positive side there is that one thing that sticks out and that is so that you can attach one wire to one wire and know which one which side switched
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_008 wires are able to take energy from the d cell and attach it to the light bulb
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_012 and negative
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_007 the d cell is a source of power
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_024 the conducting arms are attached to the bottom and to the side so that is why when you attach the wires it lights up
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_015 so that the electricity when it like if you take one end of the and put it where the positive is on the bottom of the light bulb it will shock your fingers
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_017 which end is on the and which end is on the negative
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_016 i attached two wires to both ends and then attached them both to the right areas and then but the first time i attached them both to the bottom i really shocked my finger
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_011 the light bulb can light up when you attach the right f if when you attach negative on the side and positive on the bottom
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_004 well the battery is a d cell and it has pog and and the light bulb has two places for a wire
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_014 you attach the wires to each side so that the positive energy goes out one side and then the negative energy comes out from the bulb and goes back into its side
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_020 i have to attach one to the side of it and one to the bottom of the light bulb to make it light up
myst_997480_2010-08-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_018 the light bulb is not getting enough electricity because there is no wires attached to the two ends so that it is not lighting up
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 the two magnets are attracted and when y when you drop the first one and it went under to the bottom of the table it is because that the first magnet that was on the table originally had a really high magnet magnetism force so when it came down it would attack it would attract to the other magnet
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014 the thick stack is too thick for the magnet to be able to pick up the paperclip and the thin stack is able because of the magnetic force it can go through
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_003 learning about magnetism
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_004 magnetism is about when m you have a magnet and you can put it on a nail and the magnet force can go through the nail and pick up a paperclip
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 well the two magnets repel each because one has one side of the magnet that does not want to stick to the other so it is called repelling
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_015 the paper is so thin that the magnet the magnet force can touch the touch the paperclip so it can move around
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_002 learning about the water cycle
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_017 the magnet in the magnet is so far away from the paperclip that the magnetic force cannot go through all the pieces of paper to try to get the to try to get the paperclip
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_006 the two the two magnets are trying to get together through the plank of wood
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_013 one s one stack of paper has is too thick so that the magnet force cannot pick up cannot keep the paperclip on and then the other one is thin so that it can keep the paperclip on
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_010 t the magnetic force is pushing is trying to get the other magnet because of the magnetic force so it they are trying to attract together to to move
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_011 if you put it on the other side of the table the the table ha is not so thick so that the two magnets can are able to attract together
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_009 when you dropped the magnet and it went under the table you moved the top you moved the bottom magnet s and it and it moved the top magnet around the table
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 well what happens is we observed with two magnets on table on a table like the one that you showed so we we cou we were able to move the bottom so that is how i know the question
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 and on the thick and on the thick piece of on the thick stack it it cannot attach to the magnet because there is too much paper and the magnetic force cannot get to the top
myst_997480_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_007 well the two magnets are trying to they are trying to get attracted and you can move the bottom one the top one will move too
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_004 well we used to soda can like so how we use a soda can is we got water and we filled the soda can up to the top as we did with a b c and d all the way up
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_014 that they leave some space like they they do not put they do not fill the can all the way up to the top it and cause if they did that it would practically you would get your fingers wet and sticky or when you open it well like if you like to shake your soda a little bit then it might not work well it does not really work that well so yeah
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_003 it is how much a c water a cup or something can hold
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_008 well i do not really understand what you are asking me marnie i know you are asking me to think about that but i do not really understand what i am supposed to tell you
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_017 well i do not really know the difference marnie right now zero well if the three hundred milliliter is the volume of the liquid and three hundred and thirty-three milliliters is the capacity of the soda can
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_002 we are we have been measuring the volume and the capacity of how much water it takes to fill up cups and soda cans
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_015 that tells how much how tall the can is yeah
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_010 and it is like about finding out how much you need so and the group that i was in we got one hundred and sixty-five as i said
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_011 and so are you asking what did i do or what did my group do or what to do
myst_996716_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_006 i mean that it fills the whole thing up well it fills well it fills it up to one so the capacity fills something up to how much you want it to f well it fills something up
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 the temperature is twenty degree
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_029 we observed changes maybe for about thirty minute
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 that well that when the temperature changed from w hot well it was kinda it it was supposed to be room temperature but it was a little bit warmer than room temperature but let us just say it was temperature and so it is like change it was changed from room temperature to a little colder stage of the temperature
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_015 we did not really draw our data but we wrote our data
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027 it is because they measured it a lot of times and then the tentre temperature cup changing a little
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014 and so we wrote things down on a piece of paper marnie on one minute two minute three minute four minute five minute six minute also zero minute seven minute eight minute nine minute and ten minute s
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 and so it has fifty-one thousand and fifteen and twenty on it and it says temperature celsius degrees and the temperature of this is twenty degrees and one hundred celsius
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_020 i do not know
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_032 i think it was like maybe twenty degrees celsius i
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_008 the liquid inside of the thermometer and so first when you put it in the cup of room temperature water it moves up to the room temperature and that is how much it is twenty degrees celsius and then the liquid goes down when we put the ice cubes in it
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011 the liquid inside the thermometer goes up like it goes it rises up to tell us that for example it went all the way up to sixty-five degrees fahrenheit well no celsius
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_019 i do not know
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_017 i do not really know a lot about graphs marnie
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 and so when we put the ice cubes in that made the water much more colder than it was
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 and so in the a cup it is going to stay room temperature as it is and then when you put the b when you put the ice cubes in b it is going to make it the water colder except in the n in a matter of hours the ice is going to melt and b is going to change back to room temperature
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 a and so they can get super cold and turn into ice cube
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013 well that is what we did marnie
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_030 i do not i am i do not know a s a lot lot marnie
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_031 well i can not really remember what i wrote down marnie
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 i do not know anything marnie
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026 i do not really know
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_028 i do not really know marnie
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 the ice made the water cold
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012 and so you can get a piece of paper and then maybe a pen or pencil and then you can write your results on the paper
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_025 the temperature is going up
myst_996716_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 they are the minutes that it took every time we measure
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016 well i can not really do that because i do not know what celsius really means yet cause we just started our te started on temperature unit so
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_017 i do not really know marnie
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_005 you would sense if it was hot or cold like cold you would wannna take your finger out hot you would wannna take your finger out cool warmish type you would probably want to keep your finger in if you had to
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 i can not tell what the the what b is but
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_026 marnie i have to go now bye bye
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_010 a thermometer can feel how much the like the temperature of something is and we humans we can feel that too
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008 we put in thermometers so we put in ther thermometers marnie
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_021 you would use a thermometer and you would look what number the thermometer says well the red like the red stuff that goes up into the thermometer to tell us that that is how much it is
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_009 to measure the temperature of what a liquid like the temperature of what a liquid is that is what you use a thermometer for marnie
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_022 well my observation is that why i said that is because i knew that the red stuff that goes up into the thermometer when you put it in a liquid i knew that that probably moves up to show us
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_006 what the temperature of the water is
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_025 well the measurements on the right are higher than the ones on the le
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_007 i know that is like how hot or how cold something is
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 and so after we stuck our fingers in the w the water of the cups we
myst_996716_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_023 like you look at the signs that say five degrees fahrenheit but you look at the red stuff that goes up
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_018 marnie what as i already said to you i do not really know what capacity is i know i need to but i do not really know
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_017 i do not really know what i noticed marnie
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_006 right so we used that tool i think it is a volume measuring cup except the one that we used only ended up to a one hundred except it had a little more space of plastic glass on the top
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_014 and so for line d i am thinking that it would be well i know how much ten milliliters is that is probably up to a and so what i can well no it is fifty milliliters really and so a i am thinking that it is about two hundred milliliters or two hundred and fifty milliliters to get to d
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_019 i observe i observe that i do not really know what i observe either
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_003 well it is pretty easy to get water out of a cup cause all is you have to do is pour
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012 well we can always see well if we already know what one hundred milliliters looks or one thousand milliliters looks like we can guess like we can estimate if like how by that is to exactly that much
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_005 one billion, twenty million, three hundred and four thousand and fifty it ended at fifty so that is pretty much all i can tell you for what the syringe looked like and how much we could use of millimeters of water so yeah any more questions marnie
myst_996716_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_016 i do not really know what capacity is because we like i kind of forgot because i like we talked about it in class today but i did not really catch it so yeah
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_019 these subsystems are part of the earth
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_004 a car is a system has wheels a chair and engines and other stuff
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_015 well the earth is a big subsystems with a whole bunch of things like the biosphere and the atmosphere and other sphere
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_014 earth is a big subsystem and it has a whole bunch of moving parts
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_032 animals eat people so they go all the way around the cycle until they come back to point a
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_021 zero the water and the fish in there and the coral and all the organisms that live down in the sea
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_005 the engine is connected to the wheels so the wheels will move the car and it is also connected to the
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_026 i think it is made up of animals and plants and other waters stuff
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_027 i think the ecosystem is the big thing and the biosphere is the subsystem
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_033 it shows all the animals eats to all the way until they get back to the end so they can start a
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_029 it is a a food cycle and the hunter hunts the wolf but the wolf eats the owl but the rabbits eat the wolf but the rats eat that and then the rats makes poo poo for the for the plants and then the little bugs eat the plants and then it goes back to square one
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_002 learning about system
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_036 they all are living organisms
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_017 we are subsystems on top of the big system earth
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_010 it shows some of the subsystem it shows some of the subsystems in the big system
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_028 it is a food chain of all the food yeah
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_025 the the desert has different animals and plants and the wet areas have fish coral and other organisms
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_018 the layer of the earths i see a bio system i see the atmosphere i see buildings that have a system in it i see mountains
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_009 a human is a system and it has a whole bunch of subsystems like the lungs the heart the intestines the kidney
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_012 that the human body is a big system with a whole bunch of subsystems
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_035 that they would all match up and be able to eat each other
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_007 all of the parts that make it move like the wheels and the axle and the exhaust and the engine
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_023 i see forests and animals and i see water and other animals and forest and greens and plants yeah
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_034 matching up together so they can so and that is a cycle how they eat each other and effect each other and kill each other until it gets back to point a
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_024 in the forest and stuff like that
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_020 four of them one of them called the atmosphere and the other one is there is another one called the biosphere i do not know what the other ones are called yeah
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_006 a car is a system and a car and part of the system is the wheels and the engine and everything that makes it move
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_011 all the blood veins
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_030 it is a food cycle yeah
myst_022208_2014-11-14_11-54-41_LS_1.1_008 the wheels the engine and everything and then engine makes the wheels move so the car will move and drive
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016 it is how much they are in celsius
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_002 a that is all i think
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_019 put the thermometer in then let it go to its lowest or highest point then wait till it stops then you just look at the numbers and then you can then you read the temperature
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_020 cause one if you do it while it is still moving you have the right temperature
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_015 you could s you could see if you could you put it on a scale and see if the cold water how much and see if there is a difference how much it weighs and or you could estimate without the thermometer
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 you could get it wrong or right and you might estimate
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_005 it is hard kind of cause there was some were bigger than the others and there it is little so the little ones are hard to read so it is kind of hard
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_017 it the thermometer has more of better measurement than your finger cause your finger you can only estimate
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 i think he is trying to find out which one is which one is hottest and which one is coldest and which one is middle
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_023 so they put alcohol in this little glass tube with measurements of temperature and then once you put it in water it goes up or the alcohol goes up and down
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_007 you could estimate or you could do it in metric then you could estimate in standard
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008 you could estimate to th and then you could dip your finger in then estimate and then you would dip a thermometer in and see how much it actually is
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_006 the z under zero degrees is when water freezes and right on zero water still freezes but over zero on celsius water does not freeze
myst_999459_2009-16-12_00-00-00_MS_4.1_014 twenty and that is it i think that is it
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_019 you know it is going to be lighter and so you could estimate that it is probably two grams or something like that
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_003 we had a plastic chip a metal ring and a plas wood cube
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_002 we have been doing the vision and weighing
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_004 the plastic chip then the wooden cube then the metal ring
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_015 it showed that the metal disk is heavier than the plastic disk so the scale went down where the metal disk was
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_006 m we used a balance then we put paperclips in one side and the object on the other and then once it was balanced perfectly we knew how many e which one was lighter which one was heavier
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_016 we are trying to find out which one weighs more
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010 yes and so we put we kind of to the side which one was heavier and since we put like the plastic chip and the cubes and the cube and the plastic chip and the metal ring with the cube then we could feel which one was heavier
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_017 that one is heavier than the other
myst_999459_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_009 sure i am not sure
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_022 yeah more than one d cell it will get brighter and brighter into it lock they turns out
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_011 it flowing through the light bulb and the battery
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_012 close to the battery and then it come and then a takes a wire it go and then it goes to the light bulb then it goes to the other light bulb and then it goes to the battery again and this is to all over
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_020 is less electricity
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_002 ah umm so we doing a pbm and we re been talking about energy and have it works
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_027 if it didn t go with negative for negative then goes positive for positive goes and positive
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_009 this circuit has a pathway with the wire
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_014 i think there are like electricity literal electricity
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_029 it is split the positive side to the negative side
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_015 put positive side into the negative side
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_013 so at they represent the electricity flowing through in them
myst_008005_2014-04-10_09-48-14_EE_2.1_026 because the two positive sides are touching each other
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_028 could you repeat the question
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_036 they are all animals and plants
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_002 i have been working on living systems specifically suitcases and animals but mostly animal systems
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_018 zero my gosh
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_032 they all all of the stuff points all the main stuff points all of the like the big stuff points to hunters and so it is like humans are the top of the food chain and also it is like the background is like different in ways
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_013 it is a little complicated and maybe hard to understand
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_019 i see a mountain i see homes i see trees i see coral and i see many different types of rocks
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_037 this is boring me to death
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_005 it could be an example of a system and it relates to my science class because we have been talking about systems
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_010 system it is a system
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_015 these words are a little hard for me to understand could you please talk in a less complicated way
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_030 it becomes pink
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_021 i do not really know anything
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_009 see an engine i see exhaust i see wheels and those all help the car be able to move and go forward where you want it to
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_035 they are all like pointing to they are all pointing to different animals plants and i am sleepy now
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_004 it has many subsystems and systems in it
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_014 they all cover almost all of the body and that probably means they all help the body in different ways
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_026 they are part of life and so they are kind they are probably one of the colors on this grid
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_033 a food web is a bunch of animals ecosystems like if one animal eats another
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_034 they all have different animals what they eat and what they hunt
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_025 forest rain forest cold places and just between you and me i am not an but you are kind of acting like i am i think that you that maybe the idiot or the dumb one here
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_016 do you know anything about what i am talking to you about
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_017 yes i think it is a system because there are many parts such as producers predators and just between you and me zero i think you are in idiot
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_006 i think there are many parts of the engine that are moving causing the car to go forward or accelerate it so that it can move and will not stop unless you push the brake
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_011 you talk to me about it
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_038 i enjoyed talking to you today did you enjoy talking with me
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_031 it is all about light the life cycles and and what is the word system
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_024 i see a forest including bear moose water and snow
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_029 they are brightening up just like the little thing in the is
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_007 they are all system
myst_002118_2014-02-28_12-59-04_LS_1.1_008 all of it is subsystems and systems
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_027 they are all different
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_032 a butterfly is is much smaller than a human is and much and a human is is much more complex
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_010 it looks like a bunch of spiky balls
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_017 fur fur and fleshy stuff
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_033 a human is like kind of digestive and stomach and all that stuff
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_014 they are in your body
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_015 they are in your body
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_030 they both look like they have similar parts of the body
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_026 humans got lot and lots of cells
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_031 i do not know i need help there
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_012 brain cells are what help you think
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_028 a human because it is the biggest
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_007 i see skin and stuff it is kind of gross purple dots brown dots and white lines
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_020 they are they have different cells
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_005 because i am learning about living cells and animals
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_038 it makes and forms spit
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_003 it is molecules
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_037 it chews your food up
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_004 could you please help out here i do not know
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_021 how yeast and human both have cells in their bodies or whatever
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_009 i do not see how to get the information could you help me
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_006 it looks like it is bacteria inside of skin or something
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_036 they break down food and dispose of it
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_029 butterflies have cells
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_011 that they are brain cells
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_018 yep because animals and humans are basically the same except animals are a much lower level of life or
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_001 good how about you
myst_002118_2014-03-21_08-41-27_LS_2.3_019 they are made of the same kind of cells
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_029 yes they need air to survive or else they will die
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_019 one has the sun water and food it needs and the other does not
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_017 one of one of the plants is healthy and growing and one is unhealthy and dying
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_010 so that they can survive or break they are dormancy
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_016 we are doing an experiment of growing that and right now mine is doing really well and it looks almost exactly like that except it is greener at the bottom
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_003 it has nothing to do with what i have been doing in science
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_005 good how about you
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_011 could you please repeat yourself i did not catch that
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_037 plant need feed to survive
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_023 i do not know of anything that a plant might need could you help me out a little
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_032 it might need like plant juice or maybe it might need the juice that comes from the plant
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_031 it is plant helper and i do not really know what that does though
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_040 no they do not need it
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_012 they are asleep most of the time and they like to eat
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_021 a shiny day where there is nothing wrong
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_035 a house which they do not and when i say not i mean they do not need a house well some can survive in a house but only if they are close to a window so they can get sunlight can you hear me
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_014 it makes up the yeast
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_013 it looks kind of brownie and mixed
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_007 yeast is living and the food plus the water makes it puff up the bag
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_025 yeah they need water to survive so that they can do photosynthesis which makes them alive
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_006 yeast and plants
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_001 good how about you
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_008 the yeast wants to eat so it eats the graham cracker and drinks up the water and makes air
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_027 plants need sun and wind but not a cheeseburger
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_018 because one of them is alive and one of them is dead
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_004 what is this
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_020 i am growing them
myst_002118_2014-03-12_12-08-55_LS_2.1_030 yes i think they do need it so that they can survive and live happily ever after
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_041 please help me i am a poor old man
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_009 a producer like does not eat stuff but it makes it is own food by the sun
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_040 because if there is more dead stuff than there is dirt the world would be an unhealthy place
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_014 that is what a consumer basically is
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_004 systems and subsystem
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_007 like an ant eats the grass a beetle eats the ant and the if the beetle dies then bacteria breaks it down the grass eats the no well i i need some training i am not really that that is just wrong could you help me
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_033 it is a decomposer
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_003 they are all living systems and they are all part of a different system
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_010 it uses photosynthesis to make it is food
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_011 they produce themselves by not eating other things
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_022 grasses and plants
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_016 eating the dead stuff
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_038 there used to be less dirt and plants and stuff but now there is more dirt than plants
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_017 so that there is not as much dead stuff that covers the ground
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_012 a consumer is something that eats other animals like a shark would eat a fish and a hawk would eat a rabbit a fish would eat a krill and stuff like that
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_037 they break down decaying and decayed stuff
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_018 it is a food web
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_013 by eating other animals and plants
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_024 you eat only meat
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_026 to eat like dirt
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_029 one that only eats meat
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_023 because herbivores only eat plants
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_030 i do not know
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_028 they eat dead stuff
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_042 you have a nice day okay
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_015 a decomposer is used to like break down animals and plants that die like bacteria or the mushrooms you shown in your picture
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_006 they are they are many ecosystems and food webs many ecosystems and food webs
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_025 meat you eat meat and plants and berries specifically in your picture
myst_002118_2014-03-04_09-24-40_LS_1.3_039 it becomes dirt it becomes dirt
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_003 they are all living systems or in your language only living systems
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_007 the skunk has a smell and the turtle has a shell to protect itself and the fish has stripes and patterns on it
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_017 because it is like a monarch and monarchs are poisonous and most monarch predators learned their lesson not to eat those
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_011 its shell can be used to protect itself from predators
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_019 the snake is warning the person that with its adaptation that it is going to strike and to stay away
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_015 because they can their points can dig into the meat and tear it apart so it can chew it and then it goes into its stomach and gets digested and then it turns into poop and gets pooped out the back end
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_010 because it can scare away predators and enemies
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_021 a stimulus and a reaction it is the same thing i am not an idiot okay you are acting like i am one but i am not if there is a person there or someone i am not an idiot final
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_014 number two it is teeth because they are sharp and can be used to bite through thick and tough meat
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_001 good how about you
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_016 number two the colors so that it makes it look like it is poisonous
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_013 because they are webbed and it is instinct for the duck
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_018 the rattlesnake is warning the girl to stay away
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_008 it is an adaptation
myst_002118_2014-04-30_11-48-40_LS_4.2_004 one of them is they all have stuff that helps them the skunks has smell the turtle has its shell and the fish has those awesome stripes
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_026 plant it is a plant
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_007 different types of trees need different types of leaves for different reasons
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_021 it is about the xylem
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_022 they are those veins we see in leaves
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_003 it is a leaf with xylem and phloem veins
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_008 one is like a hand one is like a feather and one is like a bunch of lines and they are all a different shape
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_028 it is the air and water molecules on the plants
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_009 all different kinds of leaves man
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_006 they are different shapes and they have different types of veins that do different things for us
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_023 they are the veins that are in a
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_002 the xylem and phloem veins inside of plants
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_031 bye have a nice day
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_030 when the air and molecules combined it makes the water and it kind of gets like onto the bag and then those molecules start to build up to build more water
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_005 they are all leave
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_027 all it came from where the sun was making dry up and since the evaporation could not dry up it just turned back into water on the tip of the bag
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_025 all the nutrients and stuff is being transported to different places
myst_002118_2014-04-04_11-47-30_LS_3.1_024 it tells the rest of the plant where the water and sugar and all that should go
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_018 well the water is going up tot he rest of the plant through one vein and i think that is the xylem and then all the nutrients and sap maybe and sugar is going through the phloem to the roots
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_020 it came from the plant and i know that because xylem it plants do not have something to make the water circulate back through it just lets the water evaporate
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_012 to carry sugar to to all the parts of the plants and i think it carries it to the roots first so that the roots can send it up and more veins up to like all the all the parts of the plants
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_008 this is the this is the this is the pinnate and it just has it has one main vein and then more veins coming out of that one main vein
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_015 i think the veins in the leaves have are the things that have that make the sugar from the photosynthesis and once that comes into that piece of the plant it turns it into the food so that it can feed itself and everything
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_022 i think it comes from the leaf because it evaporates
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_010 some leaves are on different plants and some and they have different ways of their veins to be going
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_019 it has to do with what we have been talking about because the water goes up until the leaves and everything but then it does not circulate around like our blood would it evaporates instead and that is a plastic bag around the branch the proves that it just comes off and evaporates
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_017 the vascular system it it carries all the food and nutrients
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_004 one is veins are parallel the other ones are they go straight the one there is one vein that goes straight but then there is and then one has there is more than like one main vein because then there is more coming out of those other veins and then there is one that just has one main vein and then one vein coming out of it but then at all different spots
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_002 i have been learning about the vascular system and plants and vascular means veins
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_014 i think it is the different types of veins and the blue one carries water and then the yellow one carries like all the sugar to the rest of the plant
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_023 i think it evaporated into the bag because the plants they use the water but then they do not recirculate it so it just evaporates off instead of going back through the plant it just evaporates instead and that is why there is water on that
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_013 well we have veins or animals
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_009 the different types of leaves produces more or maybe even a little less sugar and it is just the way the plant is or and it helps it grow in a different way
myst_002117_2014-04-04_12-55-49_LS_3.1_021 it is it is i think it is about the water evaporating and so that keeps it moist but because of the bag but i think it is because the water is evaporating into the air that it has
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_013 it tells me it is a system
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_022 the biosphere is all about life
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_021 there are four systems the first one is the hydrosphere and that is the water the second one is the geosphere and that is the land the third one is the biosphere and that is the life like people and trees and then the last one is the atmosphere wait no there is five and then the last one is the atmosphere which is like the sky
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_004 i think it has to do with what we have been learning in science because there is tons of little things that make up tons of little systems that make up one huge system
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_025 what type of place that place is
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_009 the motor and i think the motor makes it go the exhaust and that just lets out some of the stuff that we do not need in the car and and the wheels and the wheels are what make the car move
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_030 it there is like animals and i think it is a food web because there is the grass and what eats the grass and what the grass eats and then there is like the hunters and the foxes and stuff so i think it is a food web
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_002 i have been learning about living systems
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_024 i see a lot of like life and what is and what lives in that one spot like animals or trees or something
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_016 all of the subsystems it has
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_033 what eats what and what what that thing eats like what eats what and what does not eat anything and just gets it is energy from the sun
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_010 it is a human and a human has systems like your muscles and your heart and your lungs and it makes it so that you are a human and not like some sort of animal or something
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_008 i think it is a system because there is tons of different things working together to make it move and stop
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_006 i think there is very many parts of the engine that is moving and making the entire car work
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_012 i think it is the veins or the blood goes through to all parts of your body
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_011 it shows how that one thing helps your body
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_017 yes i do think it is a system because there is the hydrosphere and the geosphere and the atmosphere and the biosphere and that all makes a big system
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_007 i think it is like a subsystem and a subsystem is a little system that makes up a big system
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_005 a car could be an example of a way we move around like transportation and it relates to our science our science science right now because there is a motor and like wheels and stuff and tons of stuff that make it a big system
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_026 without the wetlands the animals would die because they need water without like the deserts and stuff they well animals live in the wetlands and deserts actually so that would destroy their habitat so it would not be very fair to the animals
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_015 the earth is a system because of like all the spheres like the hydrosphere the geosphere and the biosphere and the hydrosphere and the atmosphere but so those little subsystems they make up one big systems called earth
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_035 the animals and the fungus and stuff and the moles and grass and pine cones and stuff
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_003 my body and we talked about the suitcase main one because the suitcase had a ton of little things that made up the suitcase
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_027 the tundra wetlands and the forests
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_014 if if we did not have a brain we would not be able we probably would not know like if we could move or anything cause you would not really be able to think and with our heart it works together to get blood to the brain and everything and then our brain helps us make sure that we can eat for our stomach
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_032 it means what eats what and what does not anything and stuff
myst_002117_2014-02-28_12-58-39_LS_1.1_023 i think it is made of a ton of life
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_003 well we have also kind of been learning about all sorts of living systems and how and what they are attracted to so like a skunk is attracted to certain things and a turtle is attracted to certain things that sort of thing
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_031 to learn how to do it so that you hit it you hit the knee in the same exact spot in the exact spot the person is foot will go up
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_001 good how are you
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_016 the wings because it has a special design that kind of looks like that might even look like a little bit of an eye but the bright colors mean hey you do not want to eat me i am poisonous even though i might not be poisonous
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_025 well the birds are flying the dog is catching something so like if you throw a frisbee the dog knows he wants to catch it so he can play with and birds if it gets cold they know to migrate and then there is another picture of someone going to the doctor and if you put your hand on something hot you have to you pull it away very very fast because it hurts
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_021 that coyote knows to stay away from the skunk because it knows that the skunk could spray it because it is putting up its tail and it has the white and the black stripes so the coyote knows to stay away or else it is going to get sprayed and it is going to stink for days
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_013 the feet because if the duck did not have feet webbed feet it could paddle through the water if it could not paddle through the water it would probably sink so yeah the feet is the most important part
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_015 because without the teeth it is just gum and and it and the lion can not bite things to kill it so that it can eat it if it is just gum because then it would only smush the a little bit it would be like you covering your teeth with your lips almost and then biting your hand it does not hurt as much as if you just bit it
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_020 if the person walks up it shakes its tail so the person just stops because it does not want to get bit because if it bites or she could die and that keeps the snake safe because it does it for all predators
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_024 he gets out of there before he stinks too
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_018 well the person walked up and then the the rattlesnake started shaking its tail and by shaking the its tail that warned the person not to get any closer because the snake might strike
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_005 we have been learning about like what they are attracted to like maybe there is a certain color that they are really attracted to or a certain color that they are not attracted to cause it might be like a a warning not to eat that animal or something
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_023 when it lifts its tail it can spray people and that makes them stink for days
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_011 one of it is adaptations is it has a shell and since it has a shell that can keep that can keep predators from getting into it so it can hide in that shell so that the predators can not eat it
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_017 rattlesnakes rattle their tail when someone or something gets close because then and then that tells them hey i am here do not step on me or i might bite you
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_028 birds fly north if someone if the doctor hit you with that little hammer thing your your your leg will shoot up and a dog will jump for a frisbee and if you touch something hot you want to move your hand away really fast because it hurts
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_006 different colors and stuff it is probably what they are going to be attracted to so i think since they all have their own little colors that is what they are attracted to and not attracted to
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_036 this is a non learned behavior
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_033 may touch to the hot stove and that burnt them so they pulled their hand away really fast because it really really hurts
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_019 the human knows that if it gets any closer the rattlesnake will strike and bite you and if it bites you it puts poison you so that could kill you almost so if you hear the snakes rattle it is tail that means do not come any closer or i will bite you
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_022 the coyote does not want to go anyway near the skunk because it is tail is up and that means it might spray it
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_002 we have been learning about the human body and the respiratory system
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_038 a cat is falling out of a tree
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_034 i think is it is a non learned
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_035 this one is a learned behavior
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_004 they all have they are all colors and shapes and probably different systems almost that work together to make that one animal
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_029 somethings are things you did did by done by humans and the other two things are from
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_010 the animals do not want to eat the skunk because it is really stinky and they do not want to get sprayed so it helps the skunk stay alive
myst_002117_2014-05-01_08-04-22_LS_4.2_008 it warns animals to stay away or they can be sprayed
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_041 yes they do make their food because they take their energy from their light and then they make their light or then they make that into food and then breathe out carbon dioxide and then the water is just a water for them
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_043 does not have any sun so it can not make it is food and if it can not make then it can not really it does not have anything to eat and if it does not have anything to eat it will die
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_035 it is a house and i think plants are going to need a house because a house has usually has a backyard and if it has a backyard that means there is probably dirt and that somewhere you can plant the plant and if you plant it then it can grow and produce food
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_042 it is not getting any sun so it is not really not so it does not have any sun and if it does not have any sun it can not really do any it can not really do any of the things and produce sugar cause the sun is what gives it the sugar so it is dying
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_054 it is what eats what and what eats it
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_012 it is not getting enough sun so it is turning yellow and soon it probably will not it will not have enough so it so it will die
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_015 nutrients from the soil
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_029 plants produce their own food so we do not have to feed them
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_032 i do not think they need it because they make their own food
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_045 the sun makes it look green and if it does not get nay sun then it will not be green
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_036 plants plants probably do not need any shelter because they if it rains that gives them water which is a good thing and then when it is sunny it gives them the sun and that is also a good thing
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_037 no because plants need water so if it is raining that is a good thing cause they will get the water and plants also need the sun so if it is really hot and sunny that is also a good thing
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_007 we know that they are a living thing and if they are a living thing they eat and stuff but they are dormant
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_008 it looks like they are all awake now and they are breathing because of those little dots it looks like it might be where they breathe and when they breathe wherever they are if it is in like a plastic bag then the bag will poof up so it will show that they are breathing
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_030 if we do not feed it food that would not be a problem but if it was not making it is own food that would be a problem
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_019 i think the plant needs that i do not well i think that plant needs the air well actually no it does not need the air and i think it is because the plant does not really get because the plant does not really get anything from the air but it gets stuff from the sun and from water and the dirt
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_022 i think they do because we breathe the air that they make and they and they breathe the carbon dioxide that we make
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_013 i think it is trying to show us that the sun shines on the plant and then and then someone is watering it and the water gives it the water and then the water and the sun gives it it is food and it is water
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_053 it is nice and healthy and it is free to grow
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_040 they absorb the sunlight and they need their carbon dioxide so that they can breathe and the water and they turn that into sugar and that is sort of how they eat and then they breathe out the oxygen and that is the stuff we breathe
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_010 maybe it is the yeast is finally waking up
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_006 because they are a living thing and all living things need to have water and food
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_047 it is not getting any wind or air and without the wind or air it does not have anything to breathe so if it does not have anything to breathe it is just going to die
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_033 yes they do need that
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_046 it is not getting enough air so it is going to shrivel up and die
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_052 who has three plants that did not have all of the three of the things it really needed so then they could not really live they could not produce the food or drink or breathe the oxygen that they need but now this one has all of it so that it can breathe the oxygen it can eat and it can drink so that means this one is going to be healthier than those other ones
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_009 i think it has to do with it because yeast is a living thing
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_031 i think that is tomato juice
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_044 not enough sun
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_017 actually well yeah i think they do because water and sunlight gives them makes it so they can make sugar and sugar is their food
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_055 it is starts out as what eats it is own food and whatever makes it is own food that is and if it makes it is own food then it is just like the plants
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_018 actually maybe they do not because the sun or the plant really just needs the nutrients from the soil and the sun and if you put it on there if you put it on there if the or if the sun goes onto the leaf and it will absorb the sun and that will make sugar and that is it is food
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_002 i have been studying plants and what they do in the dark or in light
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_028 no i do not think it really would
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_024 i think plants need the sun
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_048 it can not breathe so it dies
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_038 it is the sun it is the sun giving off some of it is light to the plant and the plant getting some of the carbon dioxide in and nutrients from the dirt and it is roots and it turns it into the air we breathe
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_050 it is growing because it has the sun the oxygen and the water it needs to live and grow and so it is eating it has enough water and it can breathe so it is able to grow
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_051 it has all the stuff it needs to grow
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_004 waking the yeast up
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_049 it is starting to shrivel up because it does not have any water and without water it can not really do anything it is it is almost like a human we need water and food water food and oxygen to survive and without just one of those sometimes we could die
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_056 producers are usually on the bottom of the food web which means there is a lot of stuff that eats it
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_026 yeah it would it could be a problem because like in our experiment that we are doing plants plants need sun because without the sun they can not produce sugar and if they can not produce sugar which is their food they will not they will not have any food
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_027 i see a hamburger and a hamburger is something that plants are not going to need because that is human food and plants do not really eat human food
myst_002117_2014-03-12_12-08-22_LS_2.1_034 yes i think they do need fertilizer because fertilizer is like the dirt that they are in and without the dirt that they are in they will not really get the nutrients from it so yes they do need fertilizer
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_016 it helps because if you have the graph and you have done like if you want do to like i do not know three centimeters long and see how many seconds that does in fifteen seconds you can sort a from the graph tell maybe predict if it is going to be shorter or amount of swings or longer
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_017 you can check it by looking at the graph and then sort a and then swinging a different swinging the pendulum and see if it is the same or may be it is a different number of swings
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_018 the longer the string the sh the shorter amount like of swings it will do in fifteen seconds the shorter the string the more swings it will do in fifteen seconds
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_006 well at the bottom where it says pendulum length is going from ten from ten to two hundred and on the side where it says number of swings it is going from one to twenty
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_009 the pendulum length
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_010 it is telling you how many numbers of swings like the number of swings the pendulum is doing
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_008 well it is starting from twenty and going all the way down to two hundred like and it is like starting from yeah
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_019 so i am starting from twenty and it has to sort of a a number and then it is start and it is telling you how what length it was and how many swings it did in fifteen seconds
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_002 once that just changing the mass of the bob does not make the number of swings more than in fifteen seconds you have to change the length of the string to make it more swing more or less swings in fifteen seconds
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_007 well you can learn that if the long the longer the string gets the sho shorter amount of swings it gets in fifteen seconds and the sho the shorter it gets the string gets the more swings it will do in fifteen seconds
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_001 well we are just finishing pendulums and we are starting like boats and stuff like how many people can fit in a boat pennies can fit in the boat without it sinking
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_005 you repeated yourself
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_013 making an estimate of what you think is going to happen
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_014 you can use the graph to predict like if you had a bigger number like say three hundred centimeter long string you could predict like it is going to be less then five swings if cause two hundred is five swings in fifteen seconds
myst_996432_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_012 well because it depends on how long the string is and if it is like two hundred centimeters it is like going to like do five swings in fifteen seconds but say if it is like fifteen it is going to do like thirty swings in fifteen seconds or something like that
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_011 you would probably count like by 10s or 5s may be
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_008 i do not understand
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_002 well we were gr taking a we finished testing our airplanes so we took the information on the t chart that we had and put it in a graph
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_004 the x and the y axis is going to tell you like how far how what how far the the plane flew and the x axis is going to tell you the number of passengers that there what that you put on the plane
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_010 well we you are winding it the same amount and the passengers are increasing
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_013 the zero the x axis tells us how many rubber bands like there are
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_006 this line represents the the information that you put down on your graph so like number passengers and the distance it went
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_014 and the y axis is telling you the distance of when you winded up the when you winded up yeah yeah winded up the rubber band
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_017 that it is going down instead of going up
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_016 it is going up
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_005 it is it is starting from the one it is starting from zero and going up as the number of passengers and the number and the distance it went is sort a is going up
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_015 the more rubber bands there are the further it is going to it is going to go
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_003 it it is telling you that like from one to ten is the number of passengers and from one to ten on the y axis is like the number the what the distance the plane flew
myst_996432_2009-30-09_00-00-00_VB_3.4_012 i do not understand
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_026 well the cork is much lighter and when i used the cork it went further and when i used a rubber stopper it was a little bit heavier than the cork and it went a shorter distance than the cork did
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_009 and put either one of em on the stick and then you are going to see how far it goes
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_022 well i did not actually make a ball so i would not really know
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_006 well it is showing you the angle brace and the flipper stick the cork the rubber stopper and the flipper base
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_020 well i did not actually make a ball but i saw some other kids make balls out of tin foil and i saw that the the bigger the tin foil that the further it went
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_014 they are taking a measuring stick and measuring one centimeter two centimeters three centimeters four centimeters and five centimeters to so they know that like maybe if you start at one centimeter it may go a shorter distance or if you started at like five centimeters or it will go further the cork will go further
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_003 well we started we were doing some things with like this flipper thing like a catapult and so we started graphing our results that we have that we got from the flipper the catapult
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_023 well the flipper base there is a small piece of tin foil and a ruler and it is showing you how far up the and maybe how far down the ball of tin foil would go
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_008 the rubber stopper
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_011 it is it depends on like the weight that would be on it if it is light it is going to go a little bit further and if it is heavier like the rubber stopper it will go like a little a little shorter distance then it would with the cork cause the cork is lighter
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_013 you put em in between two other sticks that are glued on to the flipper base the f the flipper stick
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_012 well you are going to take the flipper stick and push it down and set the cork in between these two things that will hold it and then you are going to let go of it and it is going to go like an amount it is going to go a certain amount of distance
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_007 when you take the c flipper stick and you put it into the flipper base where there is a hole and then you are going to put it on the angle brace and stick it in between and then take the cork or the rubber stopper
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_018 maybe the weight of the cork like the weight of the cork if it is heavier or lighter if it is lighter it may go further distance than if it if it is like heavier it may go i mean it may go far but not as far
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_004 well you need a base a flipper base you need a cork does not really matter which one and type and you need a popsicle stick will hold your cork on
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_019 well i think that the smaller piece of tin foil no not the small one i mean the big one may go a little bit further as like the rubber stopper or the cork or the wooden ball
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_025 i i do not know what you are talking about did not make really much sense
myst_996432_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_005 well it is showing the b the base and the popsicle stick is in between this piece of wood and another piece of wood and it is holding it on and then the cork and then there is a cork
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_008 you can figure out that that your coordinate graph is going to tell you two different things and you
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_006 the numbers tell you the numbers tell you like what length the string is and how many how many numbers of swings it did in fifteen seconds
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_011 it means the shorter the string it is the more swings it is going to do so as you get longer and longer with the string it sort of it is doing it is doing less and less swings in fifteen seconds
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_016 predicting is trying to predict predict how many numbers of swings it is going to do in fifteen seconds cause you do not actually know yet so you are guessing
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_004 at the bottom it tell you the pendulum length and then at the top it says n at the side it says the number of swings the pendulum did
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_005 at the bottom you can figure out say that someone is pendulum length was ten centimeters and then where it says number of the swings it may say like seventeen swings or something like that
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_015 longer the string the less swings it is going to do in ten seconds and yeah
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_010 the the pend the graph is starting from twenty and going down for the different lengths and lengths and number of swings on the chart
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_009 sort a two different type of things and you sort of put up and down and then for one you are going to do it like just side to side to side or something like that
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_013 the reation the relationship between it
myst_996432_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_012 the length of string so
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_013 how many numbers of s of swings there are
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_014 i think it is telling you like from the graph it is telling you how long the string is and then at the bottom and then the length of the string and then how many how many swings it it did for the pendulum
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_005 there was one where brendan had his clock his clock was broken his grandfather clock so he showed up for work for school an hour late so he wants to know how he could fix the pendulum to make it go faster
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_003 the bob and
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_007 no because we had ran out of time but the next day we talked about like how do how you could how you can make it swing more times like by adding a like a quarter or something to it instead of a penny
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_002 i actually did not have science today
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_010 the shorter string is doing more swings in fifteen seconds while the longer string did five swings in fifteen seconds so i think the len i think a shorter length makes it go makes more swings than a longer string
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_008 well the whole class made the same pendulum and the string had to be thirty-eight centimeters long and where the thirty-eight was we had to loop it to touch to take the pencil to it and attach it
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_011 the graph is is starting from twenty and going down in a curve sort of in the graph
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_012 well they help us to understand like how many kids in the cl like say how many kids in the class have blonde hair and you would make a graph and how many kids have red hair or something like that
myst_996432_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_015 you can learn like that a longer string will take less will be less swings and a shorter string will be more swings and that is sort of what the graph is telling you
myst_996432_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_006 it is going the capacity is going down as the ca like as the cups get smaller the capacity is going down
myst_996432_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_002 we tested we took the boats and we cut em down and we tested to see how many pennies could fit in the boat and for each cup we got a different answer
myst_996432_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_011 you can get you you could probably get a pretty good estimate of like how mu like a pretty good estimate about
myst_996432_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_004 well some that were like some ho held more passengers before held more and some of them held some of the cups held less of less passengers than the other three cups
myst_996432_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_015 as the capacity as the capacity goes up the number of passengers it can hold goes up too
myst_996432_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_010 it is telling you how much what the capac what the number of capacity it was and how much passengers it the boat the cup could hold
myst_996432_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_009 it is showing you how many nu how many numbers of passengers it held and what the number of capacity it is
myst_996432_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_008 well on the bottom it is saying capacity and on one of the si and the other side it is saying like number of passengers it held the cup can hold
myst_996432_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_008 the bob started at the side of the desk and we dropped it and it went back and forth
myst_996432_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_009 because of every one
myst_996432_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_002 how to like how you would try to fix a grandfather clock and why the bob slows down at the bottom
myst_996432_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_006 there is a a weight which is called a bob on the bottom and that weight helps the pendulum swing back and forth
myst_996432_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_005 you take the washer and attach it to the paper clip and you hold it up and you drop it and it swings back and forth
myst_996432_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_003 say ke help keep time and help keep time and so like on a clock it on a grandfather clock it will tell the right time
myst_996432_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_004 there is a pencil attached to desk and a string attached to a paperclip and there is a penny in it on it
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_027 well here is there is two batteries the positive is attached to the and there is a and a and electricity is throwing through both of them to make the light bulbs light even more
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_010 because one there is only the one the light bulb and el two wires in the other there is three wires and two light bulbs
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_021 well it flows towards the and flows out the negative
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_015 well if you if you had so it is harder for the electricity to get to to get to them bec it is harder for the electricity to get to them because they have two so the elect there is not enough electricity to power em fully so they they are not enu it is not enough but if you only had one light bulb it powers it fully
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_003 well the circuit is all about okay i do not know zero wait
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_002 in well in science we what we are doing we had battery and four wires and two light bulb holders and two light bulbs you would have four wires and we try we to and we connect them to the battery and we would try to connect them to the light bulbs to see if the light bulbs will work
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_030 well the energy flows through both batteries and gets more power to light the light bulbs more
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_009 well in this circuit t the electricity th travels through the wire which is the pathway to to for the pathway for the electricity to make the light bulb work
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_033 the one with two batteries is lit makes the light bulbs a lot more bright and then the one with one battery makes the light bulbs dim
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_012 i do not know
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_013 well i observed that that one only has one the the one on the circuit on the left only has one light bulb the circuit on the right has two light bulbs and three wires
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_006 electricity has to travel from the battery through the w
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_004 a circuit is all about like a closed circuit and like an open circuit so you would need to like to make something light or like the motor to run you would n need to have a circuit
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_005 well it makes it a circuit is because it has wires and it on the it well it makes it the circuit because
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_014 well there a bulb is the bulb is lit more on the left circuit the and on the right circuit there is the bulbs are more dim
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_037 if you did not add more another battery or more power the light bulbs would be still be dim
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_028 well if there was not two batteries the light bulbs would not be lit as much
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_041 well here there is two light bulbs and two batteries and wires connecting to them
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_029 well if there if there was not two batteries the light bulbs would not be as lit
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_036 zero e the the batteries are lined up plus with plus so positive with and that does not make the electricity travel through it
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_025 well the electricity flows to the right if you have if you have if you have the posi if you have the positive on your left side and the negative on your right side the electricity flows through right and if you have the if you if you have the positive on your right side and the negative on you left side the the electricity flows left
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_032 the light bulbs would be lit more and w the one with one battery would be lit less
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_031 well in the one with two batteries ha makes the light bulbs light a lot more and the one with just one battery and two light bulbs makes it light way less
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_017 well in a series circuit it has to go through one wire thr through the light bulb back through another wire through the light bulbs through another wire and back to the batter
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_020 it is going through the and out the negative
myst_997674_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_007 well the electricity and the circuit comes from the battery and it goes through the wires to either a motor or anything that ca that runs or turns on
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024 it makes me think it
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_017 when i put the switch in it would go and pick up all the a bunch of washers but then if i took the switch out it would it would not pick up any washers
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014 well it is a switch in electromagnet means that it turns it on and off so if you take the switch and take it off that means that the electromagnet will just drop all the will drop all the washers but if it the switch is in that means the ma nail will pick up all
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_027 it has to be made from like steel or iron
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013 it the when it is a closed circuit that it it will work and then the nail will pick up all of the washers yeah
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003 electromagnet is like a like you can make a circuit with like a battery and wires and then connect and then re wrap the wires around the around the wire a around like a piece of metal and then you can and then it will turn into electromagnet and you can pick like little washers up and stuff
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_008 well it travels basically it travels through the battery and through the wire and then it goes around it so the nail so many times that it could not that it makes the nail and electro it makes it to make it electromagnet so then it is an electromagnet to pick up all the washers that below it
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_011 well you have to think about if the switch is closed if it is not closed then the letramnen the electromagnet would not work and you have to look for that all the wires are inside their socket and that you actually have washers and that the wire is wrapped around the c is wrapped around the nail
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_002 we we have been learning about electromagnets
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016 ich is in a position where it can turn off the whole circuit or on the her circuit
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006 a circuit is with like a battery and some wires and the the wire is ra the wires are wrapped around the the nail or whatever that is and so it makes the nail or whatever it is an electromagnet to pick up all the washers
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007 that means it is a closed circuit so electricity will travel through it
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_026 en well the r the wires are wrapped around the rivet so that the rivet can pick up the washers
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004 because if it w if the electricity was not going around the nail or something so fast then then it would not be turning into electromagnet what can it and it would not be picking up all of the washers
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_021 well the switch is the person who turns it off or on so it could not work if it was not for the switch because if the switch was not there and and it there was just the wires were not connecting either that the whole circuit would not work
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_022 they can not be considered as temporary magnets because they can not always be a a magnet like if you take it off the wires if the wires are not wrapped around it then it would not be a magnet anymore
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009 well it acts like a magnet because it is acting like a magnet because all the electricity is turning it into a magnet by by going around it so much so then it can pick up all the washers
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005 it is important to wrap the cor
myst_997674_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_023 e it makes me say that because when i was holding it and i was putting it against the washers they e it was not picking up any washers
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_008 well the energy line is going on the on the series circuit the energy line is traveling through the battery to one light bulb and the light bul it is going through the light bulb and then so if the light bulb went out the electricity would not travel through the light bulb so then the so then the electricity would not get to the other one
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003 well here there is four wires and two light bulbs and you are trying to zero wait there is four wires two light bulbs and you were lighting both light bulbs with one battery
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_012 because there is more energy coming out of the battery on the right because it is powering both light bulbs and both light bulbs get their own electricity so they do not like share but on the left they are they are re they have to share the electricity so the light bulbs are not as much and they do not get as much energy
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_024 there is two light bulbs both powered a lot into four wires and one battery
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018 the flow of electricity so the the electricity goes through the battery and then goes out two different sides and and one si one of the sides goes to one light bulb and another side goes to the other light bulb
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_010 there is two pa pathways on this parallel circuit on the right and there is only one on the left
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_030 there was a parallel circuit that is lighting the light bulb
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_016 well the blue dots is the electricity and the electricity is traveling real fast through the light bulb to power the light bulb
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_034 that there could be more than one pathway
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_029 represents a parallel circuit
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_017 e electricity is traveling through the battery and getting repowered coming back through the wire again going through the going through the light bulb lighting the light bulb and then going back to the battery again
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015 i do not really remember it
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_022 when the electricity leaves the battery it is it is moving away from the other wire and then they are both going their sef sefarate separate ways and going through the other both different light bulbs
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_032 ircuit means that the wires are never touching and they are just going on and they never touch
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_028 the middle symbol represents a battery
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_021 circuit the electricity is going to the right to power one light bulb and going the left to power the other light one and then it is just going through the light bulb powering it coming back and going back through the battery and just keeps doing it over and over
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_005 well a paraller circuit is if one light turns off the other will be still going but if if it is a series circuit if one light turns off they all turned off
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_007 well on the left the series circuit so say one of the light bulbs goes out on a series circuit then the other one next to it will go out too but if it is on the parallel circuit on the right if one goes out the other one will be still on
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_033 it tells me that the that the battery charges both light bulbs and it is in a parallel circuit
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_009 well on the paraler circuit on the right there is ju there is a pathway there is a pathway of electricity that is just going through one light bulb and then there is another pathway on the on the other side that is just going through that light bulb be so the pathway of electricity does not go just one time it does not go through both eleven goes through one light bulb and the other goes through the other light bulb
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019 well the lection flow is when the electricity comes out it goes w to one side which is the left and another side to the right and so the both th both light bulbs still get a lot of energy
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_025 well i observed is that that the electricity is just traveling through one wire going through the ba the light bulb and going back through another wire and then on same on the other side but they but the wires never touched and the electricity never transfers to the other wire and powers the other light bulb
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_027 re is it is showing two light bulbs four wires and a battery of a parallel circuit
myst_997674_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_023 oing into the battery at the positive side and then getting recharged and going back through the negative sides and powering the light bulbs again
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_020 it gets stronger because more electricity is going around it so it gets stronger and it can pick up more
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_022 well the more wires you the more times you wrap the wire around the rivet the more washers you pick up the less times you wrap the wire around the rivet the the less washer you pick up
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_021 the electricity is going around and around the rivet so it just keeps building up the strength of the rivet so it can pick up more washers
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_010 means it means that that you wrapped the wire a one hundred times around the rivet
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_031 the washers are getting so that means you get more washers the more wraps
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_024 well the wire on the bottom represents how many wires how much wire is wrapped around the rivet and then the one on the left is is showing the how many washers are how many washers are in with how many wra
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_013 the more the more the more times you wrap it around the rivet the more washers it picks up and then like say you put ten more winds then it would pick up like three more
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_014 well the more times you wrap the wire around the rivet the more washers it picks up so if you have like twenty winds around the rivet that means it would pick up like around six washers
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_027 well it shows that when i increase the number of wraps the more washers i get so
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_005 we when we wrapped it around five and then ten times and then fifteen and then twenty and then twenty-five and then thirty
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_025 they represent the ones that is the one on the left that is going up is the is the washers and it goes from fifty-one billion, fifteen million, two hundred and two thousand, five hundred and thirty and the more wraps you get the more washers so it goes up ha
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_017 well the more you wind it around the riv the more you wind the wires around the rivet the more washers you pick up
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_007 it has to be closed circuit it can not be open like there is it can not be like there is a wire that is not attached or else the it the circuit will not work
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_008 the more times you wrap the wire around the rivet that means the stronger the magnet gets or the stronger the electromagnet gets so it can pick up more stuff
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_018 m if if you keep wrapping it around more around the rivet the more washers you pick up
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_019 it is stronger than a washer that picks up a few wash ma washers
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_015 by wrapping the wire around the rivet like more
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_003 well an electromagnet is something that is touching the magnet if it is like touching the magnet it is like touching the magnet and then the magnet will turn in the thing that is touching it into a magnet and it works for a little bit as a magnet but it will not work full whole time as a magnet
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_030 number la wraps gets larger the the higher the little green dots go and the higher they go the green line go
myst_997674_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_009 if you it shows that that if you you wrapped it around a one hundred times that means it picks up fifteen washers
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_023 two of the magnets are attracting and then the top of the magnet is repelling to the one in the middle and then the one in the middle is repelling to the one on the bottom of the top and then the one on the top is attracting to the bottom one
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_016 so if you have a like the north and south is pole for example like if they come together they will stick together but if they come and stick to each other try to stick to each other on the other side they will repel and bounce off
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_017 so if you have the north pole you it would attract the south pole but then if you flip em around in the back of each of em try to attract together but they will just bounce off of each other
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_011 mag mag magnets are attracted to iron which has i do not really know what it has in it
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_020 they repel and attract
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_022 well the n and the n bounce off and the n and the s come together and the s and the n come together but the s and the s bounce off
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_021 well the n and the s come together but if the n and the n come together they will just bounce off and the s and the s come together they just bounce off but if the s and the n come together they attract
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_018 i do not know
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_014 they stick to everything that has iron that is iron and steel and ha that is yeah
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_002 hi my name is keith and i am awesome
myst_997674_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_012 because in our classroom we were doin we are doing magnetism and our teacher said that
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_024 well well the things that stick to a magnet are are are metal and the things that conduct electricity are are metal too
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_020 m steel metal aluminum anything that can stick to a magnet
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004 well it is where there is a wire coming from the battery and another wire coming from the battery they are both attached to the motor and then there is this switch so that if you push the switch down it will turn it if you push it and it will be t attached to the wire it will go on but if you d it is not attached to the wire it will go off
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_022 se one is aluminum which aluminum does not stick to a magnet and the other steel which steel does stick to magnet because you have to have iron to stick em
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_007 well insulators are objects that k that if you put attach them to the wires the eclectricity will not go through em and the motor will not spin
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014 the circuit is closed because the electricity will not travel through the rock or the sponge and the motor will not spin
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_012 the motor will the motor will start running but if you do not add it if you add an insulator i mean it the motor will will not run but if you add a conductor the motor will run
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_016 well the straw is made of plastic so the electricity will not travel through it and it will not make the motor spin
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_006 conductor takes eles electricity and tr makes it travel and it travels through it the conductor is the piece of metal or something that is attached to the wires that makes the motor spin
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_019 they are all conductors and they all stick to magnets
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_023 well metal has iron in it and you can only have iron in certain things to stick to magnets
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_015 if you put a conductor the motor will start spinning if you put a conductor attached to the wire the motor will start spinning
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_011 well the the insulators makes that it does not make the motor work but if you take any metal things that are the conductors it will the electricity will travel through the conductors and make the motor spin
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_017 conducting materials well carry the electricity to the to the motor and make the motor spin but insulators will just ho will will not get the electricity and the motor will not spin
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_008 ell the insulators do not the electricity does not flow through it so it so the motor will not spin so say you have nail it the electricity will flow through the nail but if you take a paper clip and put it in the same place it it will the electricity will not flow through the paper clip
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_003 ell we we were doing motors like so we were going around the classroom and we would have a motor and we stick two wires to something and to to see if it was if the if it was if the electricity would travel through it so the motor would work
myst_997674_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_010 well rocks are not insulators paper clips straws sponges anything that basically is not metal
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_008 well there is a wire between the a going from the a to the b so if you attach both the the wires that you have if you attach it to the a and the b that means that the the electricity will travel through that and make the light work
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_017 well it is so when you put both om the wires on one brad that means the electricity will travel through it and it will the light bulb will work
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_005 well on the back of the board there is a wire that is attached to the a and the d so that means that it you attach the if you attach the your wires both e the one and th another one under wire if you attach it to one to the d and one to the a that means the circuit will work
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_013 they are re they are called brads or components or i mean conductors
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_010 well the the green wire is the piece that is attached to the brads and if it is attached to the brads that means if the the other wire is are attached to the a and the b that means the electricity will travel through it
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_002 well we were doing things we we would have to attach these be there is this cardboard in there had these little paper thin paper holders and four paper holders and there was two wa and there was one wire attached to one is across and if and if you and if you found it you would write it down a piece of paper
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_009 well it has to there is a has to be a wire that is attached from on one brad and the other and if you attach the wires to those that means they would work
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_018 well the wire underneath the brads makes the it makes it a whole circuit
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_016 if you if the brads were not metal that means the electricity would not travel through it it wo it would just it would not just go through it and then the light bulb would not
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_006 well it is connected to the paper holders which the paper holders are metal so then if you stick the wires on a d and a a that means the energy will go through the the wire
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_023 the electricity is traveling through from the battery through the wires thum from the battery t thf to the wires and then the wire is attached to the brads which makes the electricity go through the ba bottom wire and then to the light bulb to make it light
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_007 well th his set up is there is a battery and t three wires and they are attached to the light bulb and they are going to t and then if you attach the wires to like an a one a or c or a and c or b and d or d and c and a and b or b and c and a and d those were not any of them working
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_014 they make good contact points is because they are bra they are like metal so it is easy for the w the electricity to travel through it rather if you have like say a toothpick it would not work cause the electricity will just they it just will not go through it
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_019 well if like say you had the wire between the a and the c tha and you had one on the a and one on the b that means the e the electricity will not travel through it because the wire is on the a and the c not the a and the b
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_020 well it is that the wires attached to the back of w is attached to the back of number a bad brad and one is attached to the back of number c brad
myst_997674_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_012 well they have to be attached to the brads and the brads have to be attached to another wire under under under the board
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_019 it shows me that this magnetic field around the nail so that it will attract the paper clip
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_004 well the north so like north and south they come together and and if you have south and south they do not come together they just bounce off like north and south attract and if you try south and south they will repel
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 the force of magnetism is that magnets are really strong and they can go through really thick things
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_022 what i noticed is that the magnet is gliding across the nail to make a mag a magnetic field around it so then it will have magnetism in it to pick up the paper clip
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014 well the thickness is like
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_009 well say you have a table you co you could stick one magnet on the top and then put another one on the bottom if you do they will attract and then the one on the bottom will stay without falling to the ground
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_020 well the magnet the nail does not stick to the paper clip unless you have the magnet attached to the nail
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_023 you have to slide the magnet across the nail so it it will make a magnetic field to pick up the paper clip
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_015 because it is bigger th th the stack is thicker so it is it is it is harder to get for the mag magnetism to get to the paper clip but the it is the thinner stack it is a thinner stack so then the magnet the magnetism can attract
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_021 it is it is like the magnet is putting all the magnetism by sliding ac and putting magnetism in a magnet fields around the nail and then it and then the nail can attract the paper clip but not for too long
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_006 it is because the it is because they are from different sides and so it has like more iron in one side than the other
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_013 a thick stack has is more thick and it is harder for the magnet to attract but the thin one is thinner so it is easier to attract
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 because the iron because the iron in them attracts to each other
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_010 well if it goes through things that means the magnet is really strong
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_024 it is because that it does not have too it does not have too much magnet magnetism in it so it does not hold on for too long if it does not have to it does not have a lot of magnetism or iron in it it does not hold on so yeah
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 well this is what happens is that the thick piece of paper would not go through so the magnet would not carry the paper clip but if if the thin piece of paper if you try that one it would attract to the paper clip and move it around
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_018 l where all the magnetic where the magnet is making the nail
myst_997674_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 well the magnetism is making li the magnet is making like the nail is stuck to the magnet so it is making like the nail a magnet it and and then so then the nail will hold on to the paper clip
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_031 after a a couple weeks it will turn into soil
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_027 an the organism a red worm is is a decomposer also known as a detrivore
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_030 they are breaking down the newspaper and leaves and turning it into soil
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_005 well all of them are living systems and bacteria is a decomposer and the animals are decomposers and all of these are parts of food webs and we have been learning about food webs and food chains and all of these are in food webs and food chains
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_019 it basically means that you you are like an herbivore mixed with a carnivore and so they will eat fruits vegetables plants and they will eat meat so they do not just eat meat they do not just eat plants they eat both meat and plants
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_022 well a detrivore is like they eat decaying matter and decaying and they break things down and they help the earth and not they do not just help themselves cause there is around newspaper and it is practically littering they can turn it into soil and make it not littered
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_012 well you are going to have to consume and make progress and try and figure what you are what you are going to do like if you are running out of energy you need to eat a bunny or since the bunny eats grass which gets energy
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_033 it is because if there is litter or paper like newspaper on the ground they can break it down and turn it into soil so there is no more litter
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_026 these are red worms and red worms also eat decaying matter they will help out the earth and if there is a laying around newspaper which is littering then they can break it down and turn it into soil
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_024 with bacteria is also it is bacteria is a detrivore and it will eat dead things to so it will eat decaying matter and decaying and break it down so it is not there anymore and turn it into soil
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_008 well it well like for instance like the grass they are the grass is gets energy from the sun and if a bunny needs energy then the bunny will eat the grass for energy cause the grass gets the energy from the sun which will give the bunny energy also
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_025 that means that they are decomposers also known as detrivores
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_032 because that is their food and it also can help us
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_020 like plants and berries and fruits and meat and bacon and
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_002 about living systems
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_029 they if there is a laying around newspaper that is practically littering they can break it down into into soil
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_023 the bear is an omnivore because it eats both plants and meat
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_007 it means that like you produce things like trees produce air
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_010 i have to get your energy from other organisms
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_011 animals get their energy from like other organisms and they like if if like the bear needs to get some energy the they would eat the bunny because the bunny eats grass which the grass gets sunlight which gives it energy so the bunny would have energy and if the bear ate the bunny then the bear would have energy also
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_009 well they are producing things and since they they make their own food and so they are producing their own food
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_006 consumers decomposers and producers
myst_002119_2014-03-05_09-46-10_LS_1.3_021 it means like that they eat all like they eat everything they will eat all foods
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_009 well there is the wheels which help it move a lot and there is like i can not i do not know what it is called but yeah
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_021 there are four and all of them are biosphere atmosphere geosphere and hydrosphere
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_007 well all the parts like the wheels and stuff like that and they all have to work together to get the car to work
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_027 well there is animals but there is no plants so there is just animals that are living which are biospheres
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_004 well there is lots of parts that help it work together to make it move and yeah
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_013 i noticed that it is also a system because there is lots of parts that work together and help each other to make the body move and stay alive
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_002 we have been learning about like living systems and like the earth is like biosphere and geosphere and stuff like that
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_020 well the trees get helped by the air cause well the trees makes the air and that is what helps the atmosphere and the water
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_025 well the blue represents water and then the green represents forest and the purple represents more like cold places
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_023 it is it has animals and people and lots of grass and trees
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_031 well it is showing like what eats what and what eats them
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_006 well like the wheels help it move and well it looks like a bunch of parts are all connected together so everything really works all together and there is not really separate parts that is what i noticed
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_008 like all the different parts that all work together
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_034 well the bacteria is like a a decomposer and so are the mushrooms and and a consumer is like the bug or the lizard and then i can not remember the last
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_003 well like the suitcase there is like wheels and all the wheels work together to help the suitcase move and the handle that also works kinda together
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_016 well lots of parts on the earth have to work together and make it the earth that it is and keep it healthy
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_005 well there is like the wheels that work together and then there is different gears and lots of different parts that help the car move
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_010 well there is a like a lot of parts that all work together like the your lungs to help you breathe and your brain which helps almost like everywhere to help you move and to tell what you are smelling and what you are hearing
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_024 well there is lots of like forests and water where animals can live
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_014 so like the heart connects to lots of things and the brain connects to like lots of to help them move and the heart helps you breathe
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_012 well when i look at the heart it looks like it is connected to like a bunch of veins which helps your body move and let the blood flow around
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_017 yes because all a lot of parts have to work together to make one big thing and that is that is what has happened with the earth
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_026 well many animals live in different places and in wetlands and deserts lots of animals live in wetlands and deserts like in deserts there is kangaroos and in wetlands there is fish and living things
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_022 the biosphere is all about living things like trees plants and animals and humans so things that basically they are living and they can actually move and like animals yeah
myst_002119_2014-02-28_09-38-07_LS_1.1_011 well there is the heart
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_027 that they they all have cells and some they are all different
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_042 that that is where your food goes down to your stomach
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_038 it chews your food
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_011 that there is lots of brain cells like in lots of places and the brain cells are big and they help you like think
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_009 that they have
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_045 well there is this like chemical in the stomach which is blocked by it and if that ever gets into the food then you will throw up
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_008 that they help they help you control
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_007 i notice that there is lots of cells in the thigh
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_032 they both have cells
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_026 that they could be anywhere
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_035 to make sure we stay healthy and do not get anything bad in our body
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_039 that it has a saliva which can break your food down and make sure that you do not choke
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_031 this kind of actually looks like a human body
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_037 it will take out all the bad stuff and it will break things down
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_036 it breaks it down so we do not choke
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_020 i notice that they look a lot like so they like if they hi if the human had like the human has cells the yeast looks like cells
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_006 there i notice that when i click on each one of them there is lots of cells on each body part
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_044 that is where all your food goes
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_043 it helps you swallow down the food and
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_016 lots of meat and blood and muscle but especially skin especially cells
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_034 the different parts of the body
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_012 that they help you like think and if you did not have brain cells it would be hard to remember things and smell things and hear things
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_029 well this is an insect but it can it is also an animal and it should it also has cells
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_021 that almost anything has cells
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_004 well it is showing like living systems
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_017 there is like lungs and there is a heart there is lots
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_018 i do not think so just because some animals they they eat meat more than we do and they may need a bigger stomach or they may need a bigger heart and every animal is different in every in every way someone can have a smaller heart someone can have you know a bigger nose or bigger arms
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_033 that they are saliva has to break down the food
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_015 that they help control your arm and keep your skin healthy
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_005 because we have lots of cells in our body
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_024 that they look like cells
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_010 there is lots of cells and like yeah
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_023 that those are not plants
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_048 they also help you digest your food
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_047 that there is a small intestine and a big intestine and that is where all like the stomach all the food goes through and then it goes through the intestines and comes out your
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_014 that if they did not have these cells then our blood could not run very healthy
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_028 i think the human has the most cells because the human is bigger
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_002 about how like our food digests and where our food goes and yeah
myst_002119_2014-03-21_08-40-35_LS_2.3_041 it brings your food down
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_008 it is like one of its adaptations is that it blends in with the sand so if one of its predators come by it may not be able to see it
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_018 because like they are so bright and they have their wings can help it fly away from predators
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_003 it we we are learning about like how animals like use to attractions to call mates or sense danger
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_034 well it looks like they are saying like go away i just got that on speaker zero my gosh
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_017 i think that its wings do so it could fly away
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_023 well like the coyote probably wants to go after the skunk but the skunk will like use his smell like his his smelly fart to get the coyote to go away
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_015 number two does because they are canine teeth and they are really sharp and helps them like chew it up
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_039 goodbye i will miss you
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_009 well it is a really hard shell like hard as a rock so if something it is going to be hard for it to get for the tortoise to get hurt if the tortoise can go inside of its shell
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_024 well the the skunk is like making his smell so that the coyote will go away
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_037 yes you do have to learn how to write because it is not instinctive it is a learning thing
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_027 there is like so a stimulus and a reaction kind of like the lady when she burnt her hand she knew she kind of knew it was coming but she did not and she took her hand off right away like she had a quick reaction
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_025 the his smell is like skunk smell because it is really stinky
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_032 they are like moving somewhere else because it is going to get cold on where they are or where they are
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_010 it like it blends in to the coral and plants in the sea so it and it looks like it could go pretty fast and get away from predators
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_030 that they will show a stimulus and and a reaction i already told you that
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_022 well the snake is the stimulus and the girl is the reaction
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_019 okay so like the snake it is a rattle snake and it is showing the girl that a warning that she needs to go away because he does not want to hurt her and that he may think that that is that she is predator even though she is not and so he is rattling to show her a warning and be
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_014 because as like the right kind of web kind of in like it it is really like helps it push
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_038 a cat is like falling from a tree and its instincts are to land on its feet cats are actually kind of just use are are do not have to learn to land on their feet that is just how they are people say that they have ten lives
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_002 about like like lungs and how we breathe
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_028 it is about stimulus it is mostly about actually like reactions and stuff
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_011 well it like could blend into the coral
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_012 it helps it blend into things
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_026 it could have a really weird reaction
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_020 well she is like like the snake is warning the girl with his rattle
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_035 no it is not a learned behavior because it is like a reaction
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_004 that they are all like kind of like like skunks have like a stench that gets them away from their predators and turtles blend in blend in and they move very slowly and fish they kind of also blend in with their homes
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_005 that they all call for mates and sense danger and let each other know and they try and get away from predators and yeah
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_006 well a skunk has like has like a has like a stripe down its back and then the turtle has like a squares kind of like a pattern and then the and then the fish has like a checkerboard pattern
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_001 good how are you
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_021 so the human does not get hurt he is just giving her a simple warning
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_036 it is like a reaction and it is like it is an instinct where you do not have to learn to take your hand away you you kind of just do it because it hurts when you burn your hand
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_013 the the feet is little tiny little cute little feet
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_029 there is like a stimulus and a reaction so when the little girl burnt her hand she like she had a quick reaction to the stimulus which was the the the hotness
myst_002119_2014-05-01_07-59-56_LS_4.2_007 well the skunk would use its smell cause it it stinks like really bad it will use its smell to make predators go away
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_023 they it gets rid of all of the bad air
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_004 this is the anatomy
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_003 it is kind of like a tree like there is there there is the long stem which is the esophagus and then there is the branches and then the bottom of those little circle things they are the leaves and they help you digest the food and stream the food
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_020 that like it is like the lung because it is the thing that is actually helping you pump air and pump it out
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_013 it is about staying alive and living you got to you would not it is unhealthy to like smoke cause you you need air to breathe in and out to pump your lungs and get energy
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_015 that this is like it goes through
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_001 i am good how are you
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_011 it looks like it helps you breathe and pumps your lungs and it gets rid of bad air and brings good air
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_017 well it is showing that like what each what each thing does and like it it shows like how it goes through and it looks like it goes down the esophagus into the what are they called zero lungs well yeah
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_012 i think it is all about how how your lungs help pump out air and like how they help you breathe and like they are like helping you pump
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_007 they all help you like digest your food
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_018 i think the lungs
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_019 they help you like pump air out of your system and then back in
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_022 helping pump the air into your lungs and out of
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_016 it gets the breathing for in humans
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_014 because if you could not breathe you would not be alive and
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_002 about the digestive system and how your food digests and how you breathe
myst_002119_2014-04-18_13-14-00_LS_3.3_006 of how like your your like blood flows or your food flows and how it what stages it is goes throughs and what you smell and you smell your food then you eat it and
myst_002119_2014-04-04_11-49-29_LS_3.1_005 all the roots are different and they are shape is different
myst_002119_2014-04-04_11-49-29_LS_3.1_004 that there is a pinnate a palmate and a parallel
myst_002119_2014-04-04_11-49-29_LS_3.1_006 there is three kinds of veins there is palmate pinnate and parallel
myst_002119_2014-04-04_11-49-29_LS_3.1_003 well there are like parallel roots and there is palmate and pinnate types of roots
myst_002119_2014-04-04_11-49-29_LS_3.1_002 about like the different types of leaves and like the different names and about the roots in the leaves
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_059 that it is healthy and it has all that it needs to live
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_049 well the plant looks like it does not have any sunlight and it only has water and air which is similar to one of our plants that we are using that was in a dark bag it also turned out yellow
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_037 it is a house
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_047 they they do make their food and they get it from the energy that they get from the sun and the water and the oxygen
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_022 well a plant needs air for oxygen
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_057 because it has everything it needs
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_050 it does not have enough sun
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_040 it is showing that there is air and the roots and the food and the sun
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_055 it does not have enough water
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_064 sometimes it starts from a producer
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_010 that yeast is tiny and they are they need to move around
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_044 like from people or other plants maybe and maybe just by itself
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_009 that it is a living system and it needs food and water to get active
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_060 well you need a plant and a food web
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_052 this one is dead and brown
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_065 that you need a producer in every food web and plants always need sun food not food sun water and air
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_054 well it is green and not dead but it is also it is also down because it does not have any enough water to grow more
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_036 because for because fertilizer can produce water
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_006 they well the yeast is a living thing and
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_012 that they are sleeping
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_063 that you have to have a producer in a food web in a food in a food web for it to work out
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_034 they do not need juice because they should already have water
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_046 well they do not very they do not need food as much as we do but if they really want to then they can produce their own food whenever they would like
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_016 sunlight and water
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_045 they they make their own food by the the seeds that grow and the sun that they get and the water
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_058 well the plant this plant has all sun that it needs all air that it needs and all water that it needs which some which the other plants did not have all of those put this one does so it is healthy
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_004 well we did a project just like this with yeast animal crackers and water
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_025 that is the sun
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_024 yes because they they are just like humans and humans need air to breathe
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_032 no because it already has air and water which is most important and the sun
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_026 the plants need to the sun also
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_031 no and well when you ask me if plants will need food if we did not have food if we would be missing something and not all plants need food
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_029 they also need food to grow
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_013 we are we are doing the same thing and we are seeing if the light or the dark makes the seed and the plant grow more and better and when we were actually looking at it today looked like the dark it turned out yellow and the the light one it was green
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_053 as it it does not have enough air
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_007 so it can start so because like we need water and food to stay active and so does the yeast
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_051 well because plants need sun to live
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_011 like that is like to so the yeast it is kind of like where the food and water can get into the yeast so the yeast can move
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_041 well plants are living systems and if say we are a living system and we are and we need light energy and oxygen and water also to survive
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_061 well if a bunny were to eat the grass
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_020 yes because the the plant needs water to survive and have moisture
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_021 well that is wind sometimes a plant sometimes needs that but does not always need that
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_003 about living systems
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_043 well since plants are kind of a the decomposer if there was something laying on the ground the plants could decompose it
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_056 this plant is healthy and has enough water air and sun
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_048 this is like a dead plant
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_023 yes because plants are a living system and just like us we are a living system too and we also need air to breathe
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_019 well not all plants need water to survive
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_014 well the one is green and one is yellow which was similar to the one we did so the so they so the light they it did not give it enough energy to grow as colorful as the green one is
myst_002119_2014-03-10_13-45-39_LS_2.1_038 well if it like were to snow or rain well rain would be good but if it were to snow or hail then maybe the plants may need shelter to so they would not get hit and die
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_018 i used the straw and measuring tape
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_021 i do not know anything about it
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_022 some are some are shorter and group a is longer than group b because
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_016 of the the length of the desk
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_028 time to go
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_010 i do not know
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_012 i do not know
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_013 it is how long it is from like the front to the back
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_004 i got it
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_024 they are both of the same in in each group
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_019 measuring how long
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_025 you are supposed to use the same thing on each group
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_027 i do not know
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_023 it means that it is kind of different than what you think
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_011 the volume or how long or tall it is
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_015 it tells me how long it is across
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017 when we had to measure h how long or or tall our desk was from side to side and back to front
myst_996715_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_007 yes it does
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016 it is degrees celsius
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_005 which cup is hottest and which cup is coldest
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_010 it is how hot or cold somet
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_011 it is a thermometer and it can feel how hot or cold something is
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 b was coldest a was w a little more warmer and c was warmest
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_013 the thermometer is more accurate
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_038 the middle of fifty degrees celsius is ten and ten degrees celsius is thirty degrees celsius
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_009 a is the same as c and b is zero degrees celsius
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_017 celsius and fahrenheit
myst_996715_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 measuring how hot or cold s some liquids are
myst_996715_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_004 the capacity is how much the the cup can hold
myst_996715_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_037 i do not know
myst_996715_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_005 it is how much it can fill
myst_996715_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_025 the syringes are
myst_996715_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_031 i would use the capacity in milliliters
myst_996715_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_022 they are both very very very different
myst_996715_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_025 the capacity is a one hundred
myst_996715_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_008 i can use a syringe
myst_996715_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_002 i was using volume
myst_996715_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_003 i have done me i used a syringe and used a li
myst_996715_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_041 they are both they are both two hundred milliliters of wat
myst_996715_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_005 i got some water inside the syringe and then i pushed it out into the cup
myst_996715_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_007 it helps you look how much is inside the cup from the sippy cup in capacity and to the very bottom
myst_996715_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_040 it is two milliliters of water
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_031 it was dif
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_017 the temperature and the time in minutes
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 the temperature
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014 it just stayed on degrees but it never went back up
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 it was twenty degrees to five degrees
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 i saw that it was much much colder than every minute it was much much colder
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 it happened every one minute
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_040 the first one is twenty the second one is five the third one is and the middle one is fifty-five
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_036 i am counting the lines all the way
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 it it drops the temperature
myst_996715_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 it is getting much bigger
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_031 i do not understand
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_019 i do not get it i can not click the pennies
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_014 it will be how tall it is like a is really tall and d is really really small and low and it depends on how tall it is and how high it is yeah then like a could hold i predict twenty-six passengers and d could only hold like five
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_024 i know that n d is will be bigger and
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_011 if you threw the penny higher the less passenger you will get and if you like put the penny it on the cup the much passenger the b the bigger number of passenger it can get
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_013 i think you have to use regular water cause we hope that they did not have soap water in it cause that way the test would not be fair if like one group used soap water and one group uses regular water and one group use salt water
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_026 you should use rulers and you should use the same cup when you are doing not like you use a drinking cup really really big that kind and use a small tea cup to do it
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_030 you could do that could do small like lower cup that and put all the pennies to the middle or you do not tip the penny cause that will make it unfair
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_020 i tried to click but it did not work
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_008 about the height and which is the capa capacity
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_037 we know that cup d has smaller capacity cause it is it is smaller and cup a is very very tall so it has eighty capacity so that we know height can make different and the the material can make a difference
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_002 today we were doing a testing boat that you cut the boat and test what the capa capacity is then put the passenger which is the penny in and do a t chart
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_033 cause we want to make the test fair and see what difference it makes to change one variable at a time not just changing and playing with it
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_032 it is very important about height and how big it is and use the materials is very important like there is a oil cup and a regular paper cup that would that would not make it really fair cause oil cup would hold i guess much passenger than paper cup
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_027 you should only change one variable at a time to see it is different not change like three or four variables and you do not know what makes it different
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_029 the the boat with eighteen pennies they are they are the same same size but the penny is tipped to another side and the one with twenty-three is different it is in the middle so that balanced it
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_025 and a will be smaller boat that though they are all the same height as three centimeters
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_023 cause they are the though they are all the same height but the the first boat is bigger and the sec second boat is smaller
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_021 i do not understand
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_038 i do not understand
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_017 well one variable is what i said just how big the circle was not and the height can also affect it and the pennies you rather use pennies or quarters like quarter is heavier and bigger that could affect the the capacity of passenger too
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_009 first i would think about we did penny and well there is you have to do the penny equally not just go in on for one side we you have to do spread out the penny that will make the cup fair
myst_996434_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_034 i think you already showed me this picture
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_009 on the y axis it shows the the distance the plane flew
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_018 they changed the passengers the variable changes the number of passenger and they keep the same wind which is correct correct because you if you change only one variable at a time you can get a different result between those different numbers
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_016 we will find the dependent variable on the y axis
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_015 i noticed that independent variable is what we do not know before and that dependent variable is is what we learned
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_010 i do not know what a dependent or a independent variable is
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_020 i think the first one with the 101s will go will go the one with the 51s will go farther than the 101s because if you wound if you wound it like fifty times and it pushes the plane and if you only get ten winds it did not push the plane as much
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_011 the line is showing a straight line from like as the the number of rubberbands goes up and the distance plane flew goes up too
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_014 in this graph that you can see the the those are same from zero to ten so you can put no matter if you put rubberband on the y axis or the x axis it did not really make a big difference because the the those numbers are both the same
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_005 this will be a line graph or you can it can be a bar graph and it has two axes one the the one on the bottom there is x axis and one straight down that is the y axis
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_026 this point is kept staying the same so that make it a straight line
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_007 the motor which is the rubberbands and the distance
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_024 i do not understand the last part you said
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_004 yeah we have been doing graphs and today we did the test we did before the the controlling planes and we made it into a graph like one is passengers and one is the distance that plane flew
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_027 i think that was curious about why is the rubberband goes up and the distance goes up too and what is is the rubberband gets down the distance goes down i think they have a a special relationship in it
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_023 the dependent variable and it went in a straight line and and some on the independent variable that i they they did not went cause all this graph shows is a straight line
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_008 variable is is like is controlling variable is like you change only one thing at this this experiments and and that variable and this example is the i think it is the rubberbands how many they the rubberbands they have
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_006 i know that they changed the variables of rubberbands like how many rubberbands did they have and how many distance they flew
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_012 i think on the x axis has the number of rubberbands and on the y axis is the distance plane flew
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_017 i do not know
myst_996434_2009-02-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_019 that the variable number of winds they changed that variable and it goes up by ten and the number of passengers is the same and they are also correct cause if you change the ones of it and that you can get a different result between 101s and 51s
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_004 we did we did it two more boats from we s we chose two more boats that we are going to do from other people the capacity capacity and the passengers and we did that into dots and then we made it into lines
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_020 we did i remember we did a four centimeter ones and it hold twenty-six pennies
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_017 of course if the water is moving m i think the penny would tip or the water will goes in
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_006 a straight line means that your boat is cause the line we see from my line that as the passenger goes up the capacity goes up and as the capacity goes down the passengers of numbers goes down
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_012 there put it in the middle which is great cause if you tipped it a side it would be not fair because if you tip it on a side it will sink more quickly
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_018 t that may if water like a teeny bit a little water goes in the boat that makes it sink m more and or the boat will sink
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_008 it depends on your side if you look at the capacity and if the the they both change cause when they bo when the passenger moves and the capacity moves also so they both change
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_007 i do not understand
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_003 we have been doing we have been today we do we did boat graph which is the graph we did from la last week the testing boat and we made it into a graph
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_014 it is about that the capacity of the boat affects the number of passengers so if you change the the capacity of the boats the passenger will change also
myst_996434_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_002 fine how are you
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_023 i see that the plastic ball is bouncing on the wall and it bounced back
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_031 it has the height the height so that can help it by go f go farther
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_007 this space is to get in so that you could bounce the cork
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_015 the one that is the one that is on the on the top it is it is in the wrong position cause it it is supposed to be on the two small between the two small stick
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_009 you have to make sure that is in the right way and not the opposite way like from
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_030 i think the higher angle the the ball on the h the forty degrees will flip higher because the ball is light and you it has
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_028 in this picture i noticed that they are changing the angles of the flipper base and they i and they also changed the they also change i think they also changed the length of the flipper
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_005 we have been doing the flipper base and we did the graph today
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_027 m i think you already showed me this picture
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_010 we me and my partner did n the length of the stick and i heard other people did the m the material of the cork and the angles in the the flipper base
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_006 m it has a angle brace a flipper base a flipper a a flip stick a cork and another cork but it is made out of rubber
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_025 i do not understand you
myst_996434_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_016 sorry i do not understand you
myst_996434_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_009 i think if you use a l
myst_996434_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_004 i think the length is about the string how many things you have and the number of swings is from one to twenty that different different lengths of string can make different swing number of swings
myst_996434_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_008 it changes the number of swings either long larger or smaller
myst_996434_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_012 you could ask someone or do another graph by you what you know in the other graph you have done before
myst_996434_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_011 you shall use the the graph that you did before to estimate the graph you have to did after
myst_996434_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_010 a predicting is tell someone a thing that you do not know and predict about it like if you add you use three hundred length of lines what number will you get of the number of swings
myst_996434_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_007 i know that the the longer lines length that the number of swing get less and if you the length the length of lines get shorter the number of swings get bigger
myst_996434_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_005 i think it is about the the length and the string
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_019 like i said before if you change too much variable at time you like a you want to make your plane go faster you add your passenger you add oil to the string you change your propeller but you you would not know what made the difference that make your plane go faster
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_020 if you add the spin to to your propeller it will go faster cause the more wind it gets and if you if you take out the sh the if you take out the number you wind the propeller then it will go slower
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_005 whoa that is exactly what
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_018 i think this only has one variable changed
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_016 one of the string is straighter and one of the string is looser
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_022 well i think you can sleep more on thursdays and do not get sleepy on fridays
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_015 controlling experiment or variables you have to change one variable at a time because if you change too ma too much variable at a time you would not know what variable would make what difference
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_014 you just asked me that question
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_010 today me and my partner just made the plane so
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_008 that wind is this line can be two dif a few different lines but we use fishing wires that well you can use yarns which would not be probably very fast but if you use fishing wire it will go faster than yarn or other well if you put oil on it it will go very much probably faster
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_004 yep that is it
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_003 this week we have been testing planes and those plane are with the propeller one not just paper plane and we s we stick them on the fishing line fishing wires and well we are like turn the propeller and it will go
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_006 okay so you turn the propeller and the rubber band on the hook twists and when it twists when you let it go it it blows and it helps move the plane
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_013 the length of the string the type of the string the the length of the propeller zero the kind of the propeller and the angle in the string s i think that is all i think now i that is all i can think now
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_007 we use jumbo straw a super jumbo straw a propeller two hooks and two popsicle sticks and a rubber band
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_012 no we did not get to put the fishing line to our plane
myst_996434_2009-25-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_011 maybe you will fly it outside the wind is blowing the opposite way or that you you you did not you did not w wind the propeller like very much
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_027 the experimental variable in in our test has many thing to do with mostly of the planes like the way the plane design the the different string like
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_020 variable can be can be like propeller you can change one of the variable means you change something about the the work you are doing and like you can change the propeller to make it go faster or slower
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_015 we have to decide what variable we should change the the passenger or the ones so and my partner did not i think she did not quite understand what we should be doing cause she is absent one day and so i tell her what to do and we make a great team
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_025 sorry i do not understand you
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_014 the variable of winds also change number of winds also change because if you want smaller times like ten times it is going slower than fifty times cause the more wind it get the the more pushing it can go so that it could go farther
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_023 sometimes i i did everything neatly for example i we should do two meters so i measured two meters and put a duct tape neatly and make sure the chair is straight and that could
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_016 like our teacher give us a bag full of plane designs so that you could design the plane yourself and test it and we also make a data and we find out that the more the more passenger it has the slower it goes
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_012 i think the variable the number with one passenger will go faster will go longer distance then the the plane with the five passenger cause the heavier it get the slower it goes
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_018 i can notice that the one without the passenger goes farther and the one with the six passenger goes goes really really slow like way below
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_004 we test with twenty-five winds and we did it clock wise so that the plane could fly forward
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_007 the top one is has no passengers and the the middle one has six passengers and the the the lower one has three passengers
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_002 we have doing testing planes which we tested it we p put paper clips on a plane to make it make the difference
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_005 you just asked me that like a minute ago
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_026 we can account for many variables that is in the plane or or add weight to the plane subtract weight make the string different and many of those
myst_996434_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_003 the variables you it is important to do the variables correctly for example like the design of the plane or you put oils on the string that also make the difference
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_002 you have asked me that already
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_007 you can do bar graph line graph which is dots by dots together and i think that is it
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_022 you too bye
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_015 i can predict that the number of swings will go lower as the the length of string get bigger cause you can see the graph is from up to from the higher to lower so you can predict that the next will definitely go lower
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_011 the length of strings
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_014 you can figure out that different things can involve different results and you can look at the graph you did before and figure out what you can predict what the the graph will be like in the next
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_012 and i just say that
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_001 m we have just been doing the swings that you pull one string down and make something swings
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_006 the x part is the one that is with the pendulum length and the y graph the y bar is the one with a number of swings
myst_996434_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_009 i notice that as the the s line get gets longer the swings of the number of swings get smaller and the s the lines get shorter the number of swings gets bigger
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_026 that picture is of a little is of a cube that is one gram
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_029 it was one gram
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_033 it is that the like gray line a adds up with the like elevated blue space
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_020 because then you will get a much more accurate answer than with your hands
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_022 we used paper clips
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010 you could do it by if you if you were just estimating you could like i what i wrote is i thought the heaviest was the metal and then the plastic and then the wood
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_006 you would need to weigh them and like weigh them and then put them on on and then put them in order from heaviest to lightest
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_004 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_035 it means that it is eight grams
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_009 it would affect because i do not know
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_015 you could use it because then you could use your hands and feel it and then like get a better estimate than if you did not know like how much the other thing one thing weighed
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_012 you can weigh them with like a sca scale where you have to make it like equal like there is a cup on one side and a cup on other the other side and you would put the object in and then like and then put g so many grams and so they would be equal
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_003 so we put them and on it we had a scale and then we put the wooden block in and then put c paper clips in the other container and got it in til it balanced and then with the other one is we basically did the same thing
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_024 it is not a good technique because miss our teacher gave us two different kinds of paper clips so we all we got different answers
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_011 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008 it is that the materials weigh more and that when some materials weigh more than other materials
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_032 it was eight grams the little the metal disk was eight grams
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_028 you would measure the weights of things
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_021 i discovered that our paper clips weighed one gram
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_007 i think it is the material that makes them different amounts
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_019 you are using a scale to measure to measure the weight of the plastic disk
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_034 the weight and the mass is that it is eight grams
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_030 i figured out that the that the the plastic chip was forty-four grams and i figured out that the metal chip the metal washer thingy was was five grams and then i figured out the wooden block was only two grams
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_014 i forget and i do not know
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_036 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_027 grams are what like the metric sy grams are the metric system are in the metric system
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_013 they put the plastic thing and the metal thing and then in the little cups and then the pla the metal thing weighed more than the plastic thing so the plastic thing so the metal thing pushed down on the scale and made the what that the side of the meta the side it is side go down farther than the plastic is side
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_025 then we used grams to actu to figure out the real answer
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_031 the they are the they put the metal chip in one side of the scale and then they are putting grams in to see how much it weighs
myst_996724_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_005 you would need to
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_010 i do not know what the metric units are for measuring volume
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_011 it is a liter
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_024 it makes them good cause you can suck up a prec very precise amount of water
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_015 s telling me that you milliliters are less than a liter
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_014 i noticed that both of the cups have one hundred milliliters on them
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_003 when you have an empty cup you can use it for putting in in the balance or basically anything
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_006 it would tell you how big or small the cup is
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_013 milliliters are less than a liter so that you can measure the volume of something less than a liter
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_018 ten of them make up a liter
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_023 it is a syringe with water in it
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_025 these tools are useful because you can go from so you can i do not really know
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_004 you would fill the cup with water and then you would ta you take a
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_026 you would there is numbers on the side and you would see how many some i do not know
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_016 there are one thousand milliliters in a liter
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_005 it tells you how much water can be in the cup and how you can like and then you can use the cup to like to fi fi find out what how much liquid is in something
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_012 a liter can be broken down into milliliters
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_008 i noticed that the first vial is much bigger than the second vial
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_020 the plastic cup
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_019 they are useful for measuring the volume of something less than one thousand gr one thousand mil milliliters because i do not know why
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_007 you can use a vial
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_009 you would not get a very good an answer because they are different size and it is not a very good way to measure liquid
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_021 i do not know that
myst_996724_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_027 they i do not know what they represent
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_007 how you get water out of how we got water out of the cup was we used the syringe and put it in the water and then pulled the thingy that sucks up the water
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_002 yesterday we saw how much a plastic cup how many how many milliliters a plastic cup had like we used yeah
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_029 i observed that the tall container holds two hundred milliliters of water
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_021 i noticed that at the cup is capacity it had one hundred and forty-two milliliters in it
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_024 i discovered that different containers hold different amount and if you have a bigger container you have a bigger answer and you have if you have a smaller container you have a smaller answer
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_031 i learned that it does not really matter what shape it is if it holds the same amount of water
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_023 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_018 you could find something that you know what the volume of it is and then you could use that and pour it into the thing you are trying to find out the what the volume is and you can figure out why they are doing that
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_004 volume is the stuff volume is what is inside of a of a of a container or something
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_028 th i do not know
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_008 you can use a syringe or a graduated cylinder and with the syringe you put the syringe in the water and then pull the plastic thing up until it is full and with the graduated cylinder you dunk it in and then it fills up and then you take it out
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_030 i observed that the this container is also two hundred milliliters of water and they are the same they hold the same amount but they because one is wider much wider than the other one and one is much taller than the other one
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_005 we saw how much water it took to get from the bottom of the cup to a line and the bottom and then we did how much water it took to get to the bottom of the cup to b line and then so on and so forth
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_006 i realized that the cup was filled with one hundred and forty-two milliliters
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_027 they are all two hundred milliliter vessels
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_015 you would measure things that are smaller than a liter and that are bigger than one milliliter
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_009 that object is a syringe and it has forty milliliters of water
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_003 we figured out the volume by using a syringe and a graduated cylinder zero
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_013 you you if you you pour water into it and then it like if you have like two containers and then you pour that into the other thing and you know that that is one hundred milliliters
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_020 i noticed that the first cup is to the campac is like to is capacity like all the way full which is like capacity and then the second cup is only to the b line which is the like volume
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_011 that tool is a graduated cylinder
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_019 capacity is amount it can hold when it is to the tippy tip top like yeah
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_014 you measure something things that are smaller than a liter s b yeah
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_010 syringe we used could go up to you could get it up to fifty and then it would stop so yeah
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_001 it is going well thank you
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_017 you could look at the container and see how big it is and then look at the syringe and see how big it is and then think how many of the syringes will go in to it
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_022 m capacity is capacity is like something to the it is like it is at its fullest and it cannot fit anymore water in it
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_016 you can you ha can find an object that you know how much water it holds and then use that to measure the volume of something
myst_996724_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012 i notice that it has one hundred milliliters it can hold one hundred milliliters
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_010 when you measure it is like when you are using a r something to ma to like get an accurate measurement so you can like you can tell somebody how long something is
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_013 length is like about like the i am i forget what length is all about
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_012 i would be trying to figure out how long that is the thing you asked me to measure is
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_009 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_014 it was about to see how how long it how wide it was and how long it was
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_021 marty i have to go
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_015 i used a straw and then i used a measuring tape with centimeters on it
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_019 you got a much different answer so it would be a really bad strategy to use straws
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017 with b group you would get a much like longer answer like you might get like thirty-two of them and then what the with group group a you may only get like three or four or five of em
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_016 it is not a real good strategy because there is a lot of different sized straws in the world so it is really not a good strategy
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_002 hi my name is nicky and i am nine
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_018 when you use group a is and for the width it only take four straws and when you use group b is straws it takes i think twelve
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_011 measuring is about like measuring is i do not know what measuring is about
myst_996724_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_020 you could use a ruler and then like every rule most rulers are the same size so you would get a more accurate answer
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020 i observed that there is i do not see i do not really observe anything
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_007 you could use it as a reference because if you had a nickel you could know you can like if you had a lot of nickels you could put em in a cup and then measure it like that
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_013 when you weigh an apple or an orange you would need a lot more like materials that you can measure and actually get it balanced
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_019 a kilogram is less than a gram you use it when something is less than a gram
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_017 when we made the one hundred gram bag our teacher had some gravel and she and we put it sa we put fifty grams on one side and then we poured some gravel in and made it fif like made fifty grams on the other side and then we did that again
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_026 you would use it when there like when it is bigger when something weighs more than one thousand
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_027 it is important so people know the exact answer and of something and they can l li and they can see and then and they can have the correct answer instead of a wrong answer
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_016 i figured out that the orange was three hundred and twenty-five grams
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_025 i found out that the shoe was one thousand, one hundred grams
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_022 i noticed that that i do not that maybe that there is ten kilograms in one gram
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_015 you could get you could make one hundred gram gram piece and then you could put that in and see what how it was going then
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_008 so you could use the nickels and put em on the scale and then put the pencil in and see how many nickels it takes to to get the pencil and the nickels balanced
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_006 you so you i can not tell anymore i kind of said it all
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_010 it tells me that the metal disk is eight grams
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018 i noticed that there are 520s which equal one hundred and then there is gravel on the other side so the gravel must be one hundred grams
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_021 it tells me that you would just basically one gram is like half of a gram a kilogram is half of a gram
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_014 you could not do it because there is not enough gram pieces
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_001 i am good thank you
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_029 you would get a really accurate answer
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_003 grams are the metric system of weight of weight and mass i think
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_011 the car in the picture weighs seventy grams
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_024 you would you would d do you would do like you would measure s you would weigh it with something that is a one thousand grams or more
myst_996724_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_002 we were seeing like how many gram blocks it took to like weigh a pencil a glue stick a scissors a ruler and a thermometer
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_025 you measure how much liquid is in something
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_016 the volume is three hundred milliliters and the campacity is three hundred and thirty-three so it is only thirty-three milliliters off the volume is from the campacity
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_002 in math we saw we tried to see if
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_020 they compare because they are usually prewedy by to each other so that you can actually get so i do not know yeah
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_017 that is the campacity of the soda can
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_008 you would have to add as much the water until it goes to the top and because you know i do not know
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_019 i do not know that
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_007 you could use water to help figure out the campacity of a can
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_010 these are for measuring the volume of the soda can and the volume was three hundred and thirty-three
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_031 so that you can know you got the right answer
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_021 i observed that the campacity of the orange soda can is three hundred and thirty-three milliliters
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_027 you would use a syringe or a graduated cylinder and with the syringe you would pull the liquid out and with the graduated cylinder you would pour the stuff in it and yeah
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_003 campacity is the is the is the thin is the amount of something in something when it is filled all the way to the top
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_022 that it would have to be full to be volume and full all the way to the top to be be volume and campacity
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_015 i do not know that
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_032 i discovered that it was i did not really discover anything
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_013 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_026 we u the metric system uses milliliters and right now in school we only used milliliters
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_004 when we worked with the soda can we were seeing if the number on the bottle was campacity or volume
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_014 i observed that the three hundred milliliters is the volume of the liquid and three hundred and thirty-three is the campacity of the liquid
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_009 you would fill the can with water and then you would fill it with water with using a syringe and knowing how much you put in it and then you would count how many you put in like you would count when you are putting it in and then yeah
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_028 you would count hi how many milliliters it takes up in all of the things you used to measure the volume or campacity of the tanner cup
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_030 is doing a math equation to get you to your answer
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_029 you you would add fifty and fifty and that would get you to one hundred
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_024 there is a syringe a graduated cylinder and a liter a liter like cup thing
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_011 i noticed that the liquid is not all the way to the top
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_006 a graduated cylinder and put water in it and then dump it into the the into the soda can
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_023 volume and campacity be can be different because volume can be in the soda can it can be a really tiny am amount and campacite campacity has to be the whole thing full to the rim
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_012 the printed number tells you how much soda is in the can or whatever liquid is in the can
myst_996724_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_018 it stands for the campacity of the can
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_032 that the biggest like thing with centimeters on it is a meter then it goes to the decameter then a centimeter then a me millimeter
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_026 i see that her nose and her ear are the same length
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_023 l it fits in because if you know how wide your pinkie is then you can tell like objects with your pinkie so you know how wide or tall they are
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_014 i measured my foot and the distance around my wrist i think it was cool because it w because i it was just very cool
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_008 when you measure classmate is height you should be very precise because then they will know how tall the they are but if you do not they will be kind of like how tall am i and like you would not get the right answer right
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_002 you use a ruler or a meter stick or like something like that
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_024 i measured from my wrist to my elbow
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_016 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_028 you wou you could still use a meter stick but you would use the centimeters on it
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_034 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_033 you use millimeters when something is smaller than a centimeter
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_013 when i figured out how long no tall my ear was it was really cool because it was the same length as my nose
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_007 you have to begin at a corner and end at a kind of corner otherwise you will not really have a quite accurate measurement
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_017 so you would take a measuring tape or meter tape or a meter stick and then you would hold your arms out and have a friend do it for you so you would get the exact right answer
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_011 to check your answer so you can make sure you got it right
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_006 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_021 it tells you that it is one centimeter wide
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_020 the person is measuring his pinkie and finding out that it is one centimeter wide
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_012 you would have to measure it so you would get the right answer and be sure you know how like tall you are like measuring the heighth
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_018 i would choose a meter stick because it is flexible and so and your circle in your head around so that would be and it is like the meter tape is flexible so it would be much easier to go around your head
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_004 because a meter stick is more is like you can have a more accurate answer than if you used your hand
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_015 i forget i think
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_027 and generally usually two things are like the same heighth
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_035 you would use em when there is for the millimeters you would not use it when it then when it is smaller than a centimeter and you would use centimeters when it is smaller than a decameter
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_019 you would need to think about how long is your hand or your finger and then you can measure it
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_031 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_005 you would use centimeters
myst_996724_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_030 you use centimeters to measure when something is not as long as a meter so you can find the right answer
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_022 estimating is all about like if you do not have a ruler or something then it can help you because you would have a pretty good like guess
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_021 you would get better because you would just keep practicing and you would get more used to it
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_016 so his hands were the person is hand is about ten cen ten units long so you could know that like i think centimeters so you could know that your hand when it is spread out open wide it would it would equal ten i think centimeters and then you could like know how to measure it with your hand
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_013 estimating is an educated guess
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_009 they all have centimeters in em
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_010 in the u s a we use inches and like feet and everywhere else else you use like centimeters but right now we are only using like centimeters and meters and stuff like that
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_002 in math we have been doing multiplication and division
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_012 you would estimate because you would estimate
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_018 it is three units
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_017 it helps you because then you would have a more accurate answer and than if you would just did not know like and if your hand was like any amount of em so it is kind of helping you to get a better answer
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_020 you can keep practicing and then your estimates will get better and better
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_015 it would it is kind of good cause then you kind of have like something that will help you when you are like estimating
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_001 good how are you i am very good how are you
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_004 you measure stuff with meters and that that is basically all of it like you just measure stuff
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_007 my the heights of my desk
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_008 from the ground to the doorknob
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_005 because if you because you would get a much more accurate answer
myst_996724_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_014 you like my the width of my pinkie is like a centimeter so then like you would i would think how many pinkies would it take to like make that how long that is
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_024 you use grams
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_011 when you have a balance and a sponge you can put the sponge in one side and put gram pieces on the other side to see how much it weighs
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_019 you can see how much water the sponge soaked up by doing the answer you got minus the weight of the dry sponge
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_022 i forget and i do not know
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_014 i noticed that that they were balanced and the white thing was in line with the blue line
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_015 you when you do not you would count you count the grams and the cup without the sponge in it
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_012 i do not really know anymore
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_021 we were trying to figure out how much they weighed
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005 i know that if you put a dry sponge in water that it will like z absorb and get much bigger
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_018 i figured out that the wet sponge was sixteen grams
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008 a wet sponge is soft is squishier and it feels softer and yeah
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_002 ye yesterday we saw how much a dry sponge weighed and then we us and then we saw how much it er weighed with water in it and then we saw how much water it absorbed
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_016 i found out that the dry sponge when it when it is soaked absorbed like like ten times its own weight
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_017 i found out that the dry sponge was three grams and that but that it was three grams
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_003 a dry sponge is like dry and it kind of feels i am like it kind of feels rough like like a like a like the carpet like my carpet and yeah
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_007 the sponge in the middle is wet and it does not have as much water in it as the soaked sponge
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_001 it is going good thank you
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_013 i noticed that the dry sponge equals three grams
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_023 you can use a balance to measure the weight and the mass of something
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009 it is when it stops absorbing water
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_010 when we worked with sponges we got the dry sponge was three grams and the wet sponge or i think the soaked sponge was was i think thirty something
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004 so these objects there is a dry sponge a wet s sponge and a soaked sponge and the dry sponge is the lightest then the wet sponge then the soaked sponge is the heaviest
myst_996724_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_020 the s i observed that the sponge the dry sponge soaked up thirteen grams of water
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_009 we put a thermometer in
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_003 yesterday we used our fingers to see if cup a cup b or cup c is w water was warmer
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_005 you can sense the different temperatures of the water
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016 when to you use em so you can get a more accurate answer and everybody can know the exact kuje temperature or some or yeah temperature or length or weight of the thing you are measuring
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_020 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_021 i do not know that
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 we were seeing ha which cup was warmer and we figured out that the b cup was the coldest but a and c were the same temperature
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_011 it works better because then you get the accurate the correct answer and yeah
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 so that you can all know the exact temperature of the water and nobody will get confused in between which one is warmer and which one is colder
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_007 i do not know that
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_022 we are mixing the ice and the co and the hot water together and we are going to get a new temperature of water
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_026 we used a thermometer to see the temperature in the water
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_027 there is no more i can say
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_028 we we i found out that the it went in between fifty and ten which is thirty and yeah
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_019 it makes me say this because when we were looking at it and when we went from cup b which was the coldest to cup a or c it went like it went up in degree in celsius
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_006 i think he is trying to figure out w which one is hottest which one is coldest and which one is in between
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_018 it is when it is hot when it goes up and it is cold when it is go dow when it goes down
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_010 you use a thermometer to measure the temperature of something
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_023 i do not know
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_024 it tells you that it is much much colder
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_017 so that everybody can know like have a standard thing for like room temperature and like when you do not go outside and stuff like that
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008 i think about is it hot cold or just warm
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_025 we estimated with our finger
myst_996724_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_014 on c the temperature is twenty degrees
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_015 you put numbers on the side
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_029 you you could add up like you would add up the dropping and like add up how much it dropped and how muched it how much it rised
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 it helps because you can know how it rises in time and how it drops in time
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 it went down really far and then it is going up
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_001 it is going well thank you
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 you can write it on a piece of paper and yeah
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_017 you can use it to get i do not know
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_031 you can count the degrees celsius it dropped
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011 i drew my data and numbers on a little piece of paper
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 you can look at it and you know because the starting thermometer is at twenty and the finishing thermometer is at five
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_022 and it dropped really far to only five degrees celsius and it dropped fifteen degrees celsius
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 they can freeze
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 it helps you keep track of like ten minutes it is five degrees twenty minutes it is thirty degrees like that
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014 graphs are to help you like measure and keep track of your stuff
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_028 i do not know that question
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 i would describe em that it would go down really far and then it started to go up up up
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_030 and then you would add em together and get your answer of how ma difference it was
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_008 it goes down and it is kinda like contracting and so yeah
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 it drops lower
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 i discovered that it got much colder
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 it dropped fifteen celsius
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_034 the temperature is changing
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_032 you could do twenty degrees celsius minus whatever how much it dropped on that side equals and then something
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_033 it is when it either goes down the red stuff goes down on a tem thermometer or up
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026 it goes up and it gets warmer
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 i put like how it dropped and how it how it dropped in temperature and how it went up in temperature
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_002 e were seeing how much a water the water temperature would drop when you put ice in it and waited for ten minutes
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027 it is getting colder and warmer
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013 i the parts of the graphed i do not know that
myst_996724_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_010 i displayed it by writing it on a piece of paper and yeah
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_032 can you repeat that
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_044 it becomes during
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_019 i can tell because keep on the energy to walk run and sit
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_028 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_043 i do not know can you tell me
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_003 that heat from the candle is melting the candles
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_022 energy makes you walk and run and sleep and you can tell she has energy because she is walking
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_038 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_033 the motor and the flag would not
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_024 by eating and drinking lots of water
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_009 it is important because we need it to have lights and everything
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_012 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_017 am i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_042 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_016 i can see heats heat energy fire and the candles melting
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_020 sound energy is coming
myst_007078_2014-02-28_12-55-40_EE_1.4_006 i am i do not know what to say
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_004 that it s a circuit
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_028 i broke it
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_006 i think that is because it is not light now but they need put to later switch on a glow like a pretty like that
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_019 can you say that one more time my knowing friends rihana was parking me
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_015 it might be like this because if it is just by self it can t the complete circuit so and needs a switch to ah umm for its light like this but if it doesn t the switch it blow like that
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_017 that one light bulb the filament is not black and red through on the other filament it is
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_025 thank rihana it is a light bulb
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_034 besides can you go repeat and get me a filament
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_007 then you don t have a circuit they both
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_033 because the filament is broken
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_013 can you repeat that slowly
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_008 a series circuit
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_005 can you repeat up this slowly
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_012 it s not a circuit
myst_007078_2014-03-20_12-45-29_EE_2.3_030 the breaking filmament
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_020 it is is power inside the light bulb that is going through the wires to the light bulb back to the wire wires into the battery and then so on
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_018 the bottom one which is bringing the power again through the battery
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_003 they are a light bulb a battery and wire
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_028 that is the electricity is going through everything even if the wires are connected in a different way
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_021 papers and the power electricity going through the wires and the d cell and the light bulb
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_022 the electricity is going to d cell battery and then out the d cell battery into the light bulb and then out the light bulb back to the d cell
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_012 light bulbs help light come in to their
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_006 they are all about how they power everything i don t i think
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_010 power electricity electricity source
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_016 it is going up and down and under
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_008 they help power the light bulb because they are connected to the battery and then they go out to the light bulb to power it
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_023 i notice it switched around so it is going the other way now
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_024 it goes backwards so it goes the other way where it is going before
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_030 i think it would get brighter to break the bulb or it would not work
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_013 it gets all the energy from the battery through the wires to light bulb
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_001 i am doing good
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_014 it means that it powers a light bulb for the room to get lighter
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_027 one of them are connect both them are connected to the battery but one is touching the metal the pole it touch wrapping around the battery the light bulb and then other parts touching the bottom of it
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_031 when they both on the bottom yeah it does not turn on because it is not working that way but when once on the side and once underneath than it could work
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_026 the positive side
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_029 i do not really know
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_015 i see going on the electricity is coming out the battery through the wires a light bulb and then its going back into the battery and then going out again like a cycle
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_002 we have been learning about how to light a light bulb
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_007 i mean like it powers mostly everything
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_025 it changes while going the other way around
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_019 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-04_12-59-20_EE_1.1_017 it flows because it comes out of the battery to the wires because it is not the wires kind of get the electricity and goes through into the light bulb and then
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_011 electricity because electricity is a blue dots flowing through the d cell and the while through the wires is on the positive side when the wire are on the negative side and it s the until light bulb back to the others
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_012 if wires because the one of the wire is on the positive side one of the wire is on the negative side which should making a complete circuit
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_029 when the negative sides on the negative side and only the positive sides are the only one that have that what
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_018 it would be it wouldn t be a circuit and electricity will
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_006 when wire is touching the negative side one wire is touching the negative side and one side and one wire is touching the positive side which is making the light bulb glow
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_030 when the positive sides touching a negative side and the wires getting a negative side and then one wire is touching the positive side which is making the electricity going through the light bulbs and make into
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_022 one d cell and it s not the light bulbs are not glowing very good and on d cell two but the two batteries they are like the light bulbs are glowing brighter than d cell
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_007 for an electricity be going through the circuit
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_023 it changes the series circuit by if like right not has one d cell and it s making a not closer bright but when you make another d cell put another d cell and it makes it more brighter and there are light bulbs glow brighter than before on d cell one there is one battery which is making a glow to low
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_005 electricity does involves those circuits because electricity which is circuit wire
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_020 they long glow possibly
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_028 ah well right now the picture had the wires both touching the positive side and the negative sides are touching both of the negative sides are touching each other when the positive side is touching the negative side it works because there is a wire on the negative side and positive
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_013 the blue dots is electricity
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_017 i believe one
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_016 can you repeat that
myst_007078_2014-03-18_08-51-15_EE_2.1_026 just it s different because that one is actually staying like on d cell one and that one is a not really and keeps going off and you have do like we do like bulb and stuff like
myst_007078_2014-03-18_10-18-04_EE_2.2_011 well the energy is coming out the negative side and going through like bulb one going the other way and then going each of like bulb two then going through the wire back to like bulb one then goes back its to the a positive side and then goes back of the negative side and doesn t again
myst_007078_2014-03-18_10-18-04_EE_2.2_027 i think number one which is on the top
myst_007078_2014-03-18_10-18-04_EE_2.2_007 we ve two you can t only have two batteries or light bulbs in a circuit
myst_007078_2014-03-18_10-18-04_EE_2.2_005 i think it s a series circuit
myst_007078_2014-03-18_10-18-04_EE_2.2_008 i think it shares a path way because and i think it shares a pathway because there both connected to the same battery
myst_007078_2014-03-18_10-18-04_EE_2.2_028 i think circuit number two and has structure clean everything
myst_007078_2014-03-18_10-18-04_EE_2.2_022 which two batteries and one light bulb will not work that was two batteries two light bulbs then over
myst_007078_2014-03-18_10-18-04_EE_2.2_020 well the blue dots are mainly electricity that are going through the negative side into light bulb one to light bulb two they going back to the positive side and then goes it goes again out to the negative side
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_025 i see feel something i looks to goes like scat would solar panel apple like it s in the joint panel
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_002 we have not been doing number science
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_020 can you please repeat that one more time
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_032 why do you want i know mornie
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_010 heat energy heat energy
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_014 fire that kills you in your sleep i see fire that kills you in no matter what it does kill you when you re sleep anyway could become i hope
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_040 i don t know
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_035 there re different because there re two different they
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_024 do you have something but i don t you have anything else better to do
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_037 i don t know umm do you know just asking ah and you are real person not just the creepy person that doesn t have a job
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_038 i told you i freaked down no lady
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_004 it is a candle and we have not been doing science fare
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_013 that s sound like this
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_016 sound energy from that person that has talking the bongos and make them stop
myst_007078_2014-03-07_11-08-35_EE_1.4_007 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_018 the flag stops moving
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_017 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_022 power got to the motor which is making that power in the motor make the flag spin
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_007 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_002 learning how to power ah motor power a motor
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_010 the flag moves
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_024 the someone hit that thing and then it winning the power and get to the green wires and the motor would it have power
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_030 the power is going through the wires into the motor to make the flag work
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_019 i do not know
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_004 for electricity to power to go through the wires to the motor for the flag
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_009 and it gets the energy to make the battery the motor work
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_016 in a complete circuit
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_026 when you click on the sign that is how it gets power in a powers the motor which makes a flag work but when you but when you click on the cloudy picture it does not
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_014 the switch has to be in the middle
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_003 the electricity from the d cell is going through the wires it power the motor which is making the flags spin
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_008 the wires are coming out of the d cell to the motor and there is also switch
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_015 when the switch is is not in the middle it does not work but when it is in the middle the flag starts spining
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_021 for the electricity has to go through from the wires to the motor
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_012 the flag the electricity is going through the wires to the d cell all way to the motor which is making the flag spin
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_020 the electricity is flowing from that to the wires to the motor which is making flag spin
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_027 the flag spin
myst_007078_2014-02-12_09-57-41_EE_1.2_005 and the electricity is going through the wire
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_012 because wood can not attract to the magnet because it doesn t iron or metal or steel
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_022 it sticks because it does has iron metal or steel in it
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_024 can you repeat that please
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_010 the metal does not attract to the block because it is wood
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_002 we ve been learning about magnetism
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_014 the magnet attract to the steel nail because it has iron in it and does not attract to the aluminum nail because it does not have any iron or metal or anything in it
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_007 it is sticks because the nail is metal
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_023 because the steel metal or iron in it
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_017 the paper faster the paper clip the river rock and the nail ah umm stick because they have iron or metal in it the brass ring a rock the regular rock and aluminum nail does not stick because it does not have any iron steel or metal in
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_020 i think it is has metal or steel or iron it because it is sticking
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_015 because the nail has one nail has iron in metal and the other doesn t it
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_025 we talked about what stick to magnets and what does not like aluminum nail does not stick and this steel nail sticks in the river rock sticks and the gray rock does not and the brass ring does not stick but the paper clip and the paper fastener stick it out
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_006 a nail is sticking to a doughnut shaped magnet
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_021 it will stick to the magnet
myst_007078_2014-04-04_11-04-00_EE_3.1_003 if south and north are together they will stick by south and south are together they will repeal
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_019 well when the switch is open the electricity stops flowing
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010 yes i do mean the switch
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015 well one thing that is important is the battery and then the switch because if you did not have a switch you could not turn on and off and it would run the battery out and if you did not have a battery it would not work
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_020 well the flow of electricity can work when the switch is closed because the two wires have something to kinda connect to
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_025 well for the rivet to act like a magnet is for either wire wrapped around it yeah wire wrapped around it for it to work
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_018 i do not know what you mean marnie
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024 marnie yes i did marnie
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_022 i do not know what you mean marnie
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005 that the wire is wrapped around the rivet
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_026 electricity has to flow from negative to positive
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012 the electromagnet and then it goes around that picks up the metal objects and then it goes back into positive
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_011 the switch is closed and that means it is on so yeah
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003 i do not know what you mean marnie
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016 acts like a magnet when it is touching something made out of iron
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_017 i do not know what you mean marnie
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014 well when the switch is open the electricity is not flowing
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_021 the rivet can stay magnetic zero for quite some time
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004 i do not know what you mean about that marnie
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006 well for the first answer the wire is wrapped around the rivet and what is up with that is that when it is wrapped around it can pick up me metal objects
myst_997481_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007 that there is one long wire connecting to the switch and the battery and one short wire connecting to the switch and the battery
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014 well on the picture on the right the light bulbs are not bright and on the picture on the left they are bright
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011 it the electricity in the circuit is flowing from negative to positive
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019 ell that is kinda a tough one for me
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_008 i noticed that the picture on the left has the light bulb shining which on the picture on the right does not have a light bulb shining it is because they are sharing wires
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018 the blue dots are the electricity flowing from negative to positive
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_013 it would be two pathways
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_005 it is different because other circuits usually have two light bulbs but without a parallel circuit
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015 that is kinda a tough one for me
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_017 well the electricity is flowing from a negative to positive well it is flowing from negative into the light bulb out to the light bulb and into and it is going in a circuit
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_006 well it has two light bulbs and one battery and one battery yeah
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_002 we have been learning about how to make two light bulbs light up with one battery
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_004 it is lighting up two light bulbs from one battery
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_020 well if it flows through the and into the positive then and then it goes through the d cell and then comes out again
myst_997481_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003 i see a parallel circuit
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_003 i i have been doing seeing about how magnets can stick
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_010 the magnet force
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 well yes it can magnetism can go through things if i take two magnets this is what i observed i take two magnets and i have a piece of paper or cardboard i s put them together and they stick
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_022 well because the because the magnet can only stick to iron or steel because other metals it can not really stick to because it is not really metal it is like copper aluminum foil
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_018 well because the dis the magnetic force does not really go as far as you actually think
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_006 the magnet force on the bottom of the pencil there is not much magnet force but in the middle there is a lot of magnet force and then at the top there is more magnet force
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_011 well the magnet force is pushing them together that makes em stick and if you move one it moves
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_020 the magnetic forces going through the nail connecting to the paperclip making the paperclip stick
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 the other one
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_007 the magnet force is not making one magnet stick to the other even though it is in between a block of wood
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_021 iron iron is metal or steel
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 the magnet force is making the magnets stick together so when you move one magnet it moves the other
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_019 when the magnet is sticking to the nail the magnet becomes a temporary magnet so the magnetic force is going through the nail and making the paperclip stick to the nail
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 the magnet force between them if you flip a magnet and you try to push em together the magnet force pushes them apart
myst_997481_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_009 the magnet force is pushing already
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_017 insulators are different by because it is just different like people are not are different than insulators and stuff that is how it is different it is different
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_008 and usually sponge does not work the ring and stuff do not work usually stuff that are not metal do not work and stuff that are metal work because it just works
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_014 nothing is really happening inside and
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_002 we ve been learning about energy
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_010 well usually what makes the motor work is metal nothing else pretty much works
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_005 it has a battery it has a motor and it has a nail and a switch
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_007 it starts to move because usually when usually metal stuff work and the things that do not work are usually not metal
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_012 the circuit that has the motor in it is not working because obviously it is the stick is made out of wood wood is not made out of metals so it is not going to work
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_016 usually an insulator is metal and a conductor is usually something else
myst_007073_2014-02-25_12-16-08_EE_1.3_022 when an insulator the insulator did not work
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_009 they do if you put the battery and the wires together they the energy goes through into the light bulb
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_002 i have been learning about energy
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_008 i think it is just possibly because it is kind of like a path because it is so like then
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_013 a receiver is another word for a light bulb
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_007 what they do is they give more energy kind of
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_029 are not connected that you would not be able to create energy to the light bulb and make light with that
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_023 that the battery turned around and now it is doing the opposite thing
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_017 it kind of depends
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_019 well there is red on that side and there is a flat side on that side
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_012 they help you see in many places
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_006 source is another word for something that helps you i guess
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_032 it did not work because if you do not put one side on the side like one wire on the side it would not work because it has to give energy to the top two
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_011 light bulbs are something that gives you light
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_024 now it is the minus sign is giving energy to the light bulb and then the light bulb is giving energy to the battery again
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_003 one is wire two wires a battery and a light bulb
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_010 they usually carry metal inside of the little stuff and it goes in stuff i guess
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_016 well where the minus sign is energy is going through the light bulb and then the light bulb has energy that is going back to the light bulb and i guess it keeps on going
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_014 that means that is how they put it together they did very good and that they made light
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_028 i am sorry i do not know
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_033 okay bye you have been really good to me i hope i see you next time
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_015 real tiny energy is going through the metal into the light bulb and there is energy coming out of the light bulb into the batttery
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_020 i do not know
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_025 well when i flip the d cell the plus sign gives energy to the light bulb and then the minus sign or the light bulb then gives energy to the minus sign
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_030 it will not create energy and your bulb will not light
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_004 they give out energy for stuff
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_027 what do you mean
myst_007073_2014-02-04_13-20-40_EE_1.1_018 where other is a minus sign
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_003 there are all kinds of magnets first it is a donut magnet then it is a horseshoe magnet and then it is just a regular magnet
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_001 i am good how are you i am good how are you
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_025 it sticks because it has iron and or no s yeah iron so that s why the gray rock sticks to the magnet there are no magnet
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_007 it is because the nail is steel and anything steel or iron makes magnet stick to it so i am guessing that is either steel or iron
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_020 the nail sticks to the magnet because it is made out of steel the other one is not made out of steel so it will not be able to stick
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_011 well the nail is not saint i mean the magnet is not sticking to the block because it is not made out of steel or iron it is made out of wood and wood does not stick to anything magnetic so it is not that s why it is not sticking so
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_026 what will happen is it will strat sticking it will start sticking and yeah that is it
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_002 we have been doing a lot with batteries
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_018 it is like probably like little tiny magnets because some magnets stick together
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_024 zero my god that sticks i never knew that wow i just learned something new today
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_015 so what is happening is because the steel that is on the magnet the the nail is on the magnet that is made out of steel but what is the other steel i mean the other nail is probably made out of copper or something but it is not steel or iron so it is probably copper and iron or steel so
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_021 well it is the steel one because the other one is not made out steel or iron so it can not stick that is why i will pick the steel iron nail and not the other one
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_005 well anything that is steel or iron attracts to it and anything that is with an if you put two magnets together and they can become a force
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_012 well magnets stick to anything steel and iron like it sticks to it s does sometimes stick to other magnets but sometimes they have a force to each other
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_004 well they carry energy inside of it and stick to anything steel and metal
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_019 so like you probably think that a spoon sticks to magnet does not because it is not iron it is not made out iron or steel but it looks like it is made out of iron but it is not so sometimes it looks like it is made out of iron or steel but it really is not
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_010 yes because the whole entire nail is made out of steel so steel sticks to anything that made it
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_006 it is made out of iron or steel
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_027 what will happen is that the steel nail is sticking to the magnet because it is made out of steel steel or iron and like i told you earlier today steel or iron sticks to a magnet or sometimes even a magnet so
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_023 when a gray rock touches the magnet it actually really depends because some of them do have iron or steel in it but some of then do not too so it really depends i think you would have to try it out as well so
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_017 because magnets could only stick to two types of metals i know of they sti stick to steel and iron and those two are made out of those two are different magnets so that is how i know
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_016 because one nail is made out of steel yeah steel and the other nail is probably made out of copper so that is why it is the steel one is sticking to the magnet and the copper one is not so that is why
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_008 well it is because we have been learning about that magnets in in class so now we are like a magnet expert
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_009 well the stee the magnet is sticking to the steel nail because anything really iron or steel sticks to magnet
myst_007073_2014-04-16_12-41-57_EE_3.1_013 well it is because the wood brick or block is not ha does not have anything magnetic or steel or iron inside of it so you can not stick wood can not stick to anything to a magnet but since this nail is made out of steel or iron steel it can stick to a magnet
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_020 if you add more light bulbs to it and no more wires it might not work but if you add more light bulbs on wire wires it can probably work
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_022 when we added another d cell it started the two light bulbs had their own whole big chunk of energy they keep on going and going and it lights up more
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_014 the blue dots are the energy flowing through
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_013 the d cell the d cell flows through the wire or to the pathway and travels into the light bulb out of the light bulb and then it goes back into one light bulb and then back to the d cell
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_012 well the d cell is flowing through one light bulb and then more d cell with one wire d cell is going through another wire into the other light bulb and back to the battery
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_007 well the d cell flow the wires is like a pathway and the d cell are kind of like the little people that travel through the pathway and go into the light bulb and make the light bulb work
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_021 if you have one for each light bulb it would be as bright as it could be but if you if they have to if you put that a lot of light bulbs and you they are only sharing one d cell it is going to be dim because it is there is not enough energy for all of them
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_005 because a light bulb is lighting up and that s the same thing but there is with the circuit there is a place where the battery could be
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_017 see that it is working
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_002 we ve been trying to light up two light bulbs
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_011 well they you could also say something else instead of pathway maybe you could say you built a pathway or something
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_015 we think of them as little people walking through the pathway into kind of like a cave
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_024 i see that they the right on the right they start to light up more and more once they take a light bulb away it does not work and with the other one it is very dim and they will take it away
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_004 circuit helps a light bulb light up
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_023 when you add more d cells they start to light up more and more
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_010 well the circuit sometimes holds the battery and sometimes there is a spot for the light bulb as well and the pathway the d cell flows through the pathway into the into the light bulb and makes the light bulb work
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_026 they start to work and you could see the d cell flowing into the wires and into the bulb and out to the bulb
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_008 the exact same thing just twist it is easier because some materials the circuit holds
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_003 a circuit makes a light bulb light up and it helps instead of using your hands
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_028 by putting the plus sign onto the minus sign and then the plus sign is out on to the wires then the minus sign on to the other wire
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_006 i think that it needs energy ah from the d cell and goes up to the light bulb to light up
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_016 by the d cell
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_025 it can not be flowing either because the d cell is out of energy or the light bulb does not work anymore
myst_007073_2014-03-18_08-43-51_EE_2.1_027 maybe because the battery has to be obstructing way to for it to light up
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_022 energy flows
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_004 an important piece so you will not know so you would not know that it starts to work and if you do not have that then you won t know if it is working or not and you are going to have to keep trying and keep trying and it s then an important piece
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_013 it it does not work and it turns off
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_024 no because if the cloudy day is blocking the sun
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_011 switch is closed the battery turns on because of the switch the switch controls part of the battery or part of the wire and the wire controls the motor
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_029 this picture show a battery plugged that has two wires on the side of it and it is connected to the motor and then the motor has a little flag and then the flag moves and tells you that it is working
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_006 it needs energy for it to run or gasoline
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_015 it turns on once you turn on the switch
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_005 if the flag is moving that means that it is working
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_003 a little flag is moving very very quickly and that means that is working
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_002 we have been doing how to make a motor run and how to light a light bulb and we are learning about energy and light sources
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_018 we are about to learn about those and we are going to learn today i am pretty sure and that gets or that is a piece of electricity because if we put it where the sun is because the sun has energy when you put that on close to the sun it gathers energy into those little things
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_028 when the sun gives to the motor it starts to move
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_016 switch is very close to another piece of wire and if that is when it you know that it is on when it is off it is farther away from the wire
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_026 when the sun is out the when the sun is out the flag starts to move because the sun carries energy
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_027 sun is moving and working
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_017 when the switch is open it does not work
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_010 it is a switch that could turn it the flag move and you could turn it off and on just like a switch for a light bulb
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_007 the wires are like a pathway energy goes through it into the motor and makes it work
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_012 because when the switch is off when the book when the switch is off it doesn t work
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_009 because batteries inside of it they have energy and the energy flows through the wires into the motor and makes it work and so makes the flags that little flag spin
myst_007073_2014-02-12_10-02-34_EE_1.2_021 energy is flowing through the wires
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_033 flame it would create a huge flame
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_014 it makes the big thump
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_035 makes a heat flame
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_030 because those two things burn
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_022 i see two big logs apple candle and a gasoline thingy all those are energy things
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_017 you can hear a loud sound
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_032 it would create a big flame yeah big flame
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_024 you see kind of like a gray thing like a gray cloud going up
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_003 because without energy we could not be moving
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_023 there it would cause a flame
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_034 because they are both different energy they get energy by different things
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_016 it makes a loud sound and you are wasting your energy
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_029 they get energy by the same thing
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_002 we ve been trying to learn about trying to make two light bulbs works in one circuit
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_013 giving out heat
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_010 yes i hear flames burning
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_004 i see a candle and some wire and it keeps on going lower lower and lower and then once it is too low it the fire runs out
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_027 i do not know
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_018 the girl is using her energy to walk
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_012 fire or the flame is moving side to side
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_009 the heat is probably flowing and giving us energy
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_006 you would say fuel heat
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_005 it gets smaller
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_037 you would have to throw it away
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_015 it is because energy is usually when you move
myst_007073_2014-03-07_09-50-30_EE_1.4_021 my food and apples fruits vegetables
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_002 we have been doing we have been studying about electricity
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014 to make sure that there is power flowing through it and make sure that you wrap the wire around the nails so it can ha so it can so it can have power in order to pick up the washers
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_019 it is it is a closed because energy the in the electricity that is flowing in a closed circuit so it is closed
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016 the switch is on so there is electricity flowing through it and the magnet is it has power so it is picking up the washers
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007 that it is picking up the washers
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009 it it is giving it more power the magnet more power
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013 well the wi the wire a w if you put a wire around a piece of metal it it is making it a magnet just in a piece of iron or metal you can just wrap around piece of wire and it would be and that is how you get an electromagnet
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006 i do not understand
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010 when wire is wrapped around a kind of magnet
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012 marnie are you still there
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005 when the switch is on electricity is flowing but and it and it is picking up washers but when it is off it does not have any electricity because it is not a closed circuit so el electricity can not flow through it so it is not picking any anything up but when the switch is on it is picking stuff
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015 you can make an electromagnet
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004 it is a circuit that is the iron l we see how many washers the iron can pick the steel thingy
myst_997487_2010-08-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_020 i have to go marnie see ya
myst_997487_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_019 you need energy to flow in order to light the bulb
myst_997487_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_007 when order to light the bulb there needs to be another wire and so there needs to be a wire in order to light the bulb
myst_997487_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_010 they are made out of metal
myst_997487_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_015 nect the wire you connect the wires where the other wire is hitting
myst_997487_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_008 i do not remember
myst_997487_2010-28-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_005 so on the mystery board the wire was on a and c so when i put the others wires connecting the battery with the light bulb when i connected it to a and c which had the wires inside them the light bulb light bulb lit
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_002 we have been studying magnetism about magnets
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_017 if it is too far away and there is something really thick in between it it can not get it but there is a short distance between it it it can it ha it can it can get it like it has enough force
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_001 i am good
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_015 i am done
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_006 it was about that like south and north if you put north and to north they will pull each other away but if you put south and north they will stick together
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_020 the nail could not get the paperclip because the magnet was not there so and then when the magnet got the nail it could get the paperclip
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014 yes it is correct
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_012 yes i did
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_011 i do not understand
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_016 on the thick stack the force is stronger so it can get it and then the thick stack the force is lighter because there is too much in between it so it does not have as much force
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_013 well the one that i the ma the paperclip that is sticking to the magnet it is because the paper is thinner so it can so it sticks together but the other piece of paper is too thick so they can attract each other
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_005 s come together or they a they they move each other away apart
myst_997487_2009-10-12_00-00-00_ME_1.2_008 they are attracting each other
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_028 zero well i think the m is like the battery and the black skinny things are like wires
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013 well the battery i was giving electricity like power into the wire and it is running th through the wire into the motor giving the motor power and then it runs back to the other wire and then back into the battery and out again
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_024 well the switch i it is metal and so the electricity is running through it and back to the other wire and back to the battery and so it when it is up the when the switch is off it does not let the electricity run all the way
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005 they are wires and electricity power travels through them
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019 well electricity is flowing so it is closed
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_027 i see an m and symbol
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017 well the motor has for it to be running it needs electricity
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_016 i am not really sure
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_014 it is going in circles and it is giving power to the motor
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_010 well the battery the wires they like have electricity that runs through it and gives it power to anything like the light bulb or a motor
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_007 well you put a wire and the battery the power that is inside the battery runs through the wire and lights up the light bulb or makes the motor spin
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008 it has a lot of energy
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_004 you use electricity
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_012 the battery is electricity is running through the wire and giving it to the motor and the motor is spinning
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_006 that it has power inside it
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002 we have been studying electricity
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011 that it goes in circles
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_026 it is off because there is no electricity going giving it power
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_023 it makes the electricity run and it lets the motor spin run
myst_997487_2010-21-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018 well by circuit is where everything goes like in circles
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_016 pathway and for a parallel it is two pathways which is giving it more power
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_008 well the electricity is going faster in the parallel circuit
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_006 if there is another light bulb or they all burn out
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_012 but it has more wires
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_018 i i would do a parallel because a parallel has two pathways which makes the light bulb re brighter so if it is really dark i would make it it would make it brighter and if it was a series it would not be that bright so that is why i would choose a parallel
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_011 more power than the serious circuit
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_017 parallel because if one is burned out and not the other ones will not burn out but if it is a series series circuit if one burns out they are all going to burn out so a parallel circuit would be better
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_005 that the wires are not like really touching each other
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_004 well if it is not a parallel circuit the other one will burn out but it is a if it is a parallel circuit it will not burn out
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_014 well when the wires touch each other it is giving electricity into both of them and it it gives more power
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_001 well we have been doing parallel circ
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_013 the they the wires are touching and that is giving more power into both wires which gives more power into the light bulb
myst_997487_2010-04-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_009 well it is really it is really fast it is faster than the serious circuit
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010 i do not know what you mean
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_005 yes mainly it was the washer
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_020 i do not know you what you mean
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_013 a shoe is in a scale and nothing is on the other side so the shoe is on is on
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_004 i am sorry i do not know what you mean
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_029 yes if it is on a scale
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_014 the lower side
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_015 i do not know what you mean
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_031 a plastic chip and paperclips are on a scale and cups and they are equal
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_026 well we were we had a little che chart and we would made we would put one of the materials in a c in a cup on the scale and we would see how many paperclips was equal to the amount of that object we put in the cup
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_028 balance because sometimes you are not right with your hands
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_022 i know that because like let us say a metal bar weighs more than p a plastic bar that is how i know
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_027 it weighs the same amount
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_011 no we used a scale
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008 what they are made of
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_030 i know i mean
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_016 counter weights are things that make other things on a scale even like str like straight side to side
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_003 we were we were doing measuring and yeah that stuff
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_017 an invisible man is holding the plastic chip and the metal disk above the scale
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_002 i have been doing multiplication and division
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_021 cause metal weighs more than plastic
myst_999455_2009-07-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_019 the plastic chip and the metal disk are on a scale and the plastic chip it weighs wha weighs less than the metal disk
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002 in science right now i have been learning about electricity
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_011 a battery and the circuit needs to be in a in a whole circle so that it powers it the light bulb
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_009 i do not know
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_005 the green stuff is wires
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_012 circuits are is like the battery it helps power the light bulb without a circuit you would not be able to power the light bulb
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_001 it is going great right now
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_010 the the battery provides an electric pathway to power it a light bulb
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_003 so the thing with the and the minus is is a battery
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_004 the the red thing is a light bulb
myst_997496_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_007 the battery or d cell in a circuit powers if you are using a light bulb it powers the light bulb
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_023 it was nice talking with you
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_009 i am seeing two pathways
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015 i do not understand
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_007 the blue dots are carrying electricity to the light bulb and powering it
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_004 the circuit i see there is a parallel circuit
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_021 well the battery has two pathways so the electricity does not share does not the batteries do not okay the light bulbs do not share the electricity so the lights are not dim
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003 h i think one battery is lighting two light bulbs and two pathways
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_008 well the electricity is coming from the negative side of the battery to the positive side of the battery
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_012 the symbol with the circle with a loop in it is a light bulb and the two lines in the middle are is a d cell and the and the lines connecting from the d cell to the light bulb are wires
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019 well the series shares okay so the series the has two light bulbs they are sharing the same electricity from the battery and the parallel pathway has two pathways so it the lights are more is not dim like the series
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_006 the blue dots are coming from the negative side of the battery and going into the light bulb and out of the light bulb to the positive side of the battery
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011 yes i have
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018 well the circuit on the right has is a parallel pathway and the circuit on the left is a series
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_010 i do not understand
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014 because it has two pathways
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_002 in science i have been learning about parallel circuits and other circuits
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_017 well i know it is a circuit
myst_997496_2010-29-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_016 i have no idea
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_010 they carry electricity
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_025 it goes the opposite way which going now its going the left wing not direct
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_011 the light bulbs are about like to the send those light so then you could see where you re going it is not just a pitch black plate
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_019 the end of the d cell like with the minus on a
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_032 they go to that direction in that makes a light bulb work it give likes give like they get on this one right here on the right side it will
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_006 i mean like a do like and like make select bulb work because it seem so power to it through the wire it sends off power to the light
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_026 it goes to opposite way it was flowing
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_017 how are you doing today
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_015 i see electricity going to the line going in the circuit so than they could give make the light bulb work
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_009 i think travels means like it goes like through the wires and now to the light bulb to send off electricity
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_031 i think it wouldn t work because then it then energy was shut off and it won t work because just can we tried and didn t work
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_030 if focus by the battery in the battery release it is all it is energy just light of the light bulb and a make it work but if it doesn t work then the light bulb is out of power
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_005 the d cell has been importing because then it gives up electriciy don t make the light bulb work
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_029 i don t seen anything so can you give some hands about
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_024 i don t notice anything i m sorry i don t notice anything
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_018 through electricity flows by the wires i see in this picture i was going through in going now that is how it work
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_004 there are about to make stuff work in how it does work like say how to like remove a needs battery so it makes it work
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_022 the blue dots represent that the blue dots represent the electricity flow
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_013 it means like a receives the electricity from the wires
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_014 when i think light means that it does stuff to no where you re going like a flashlight it shines that stuff but its shines on a mirror it reflects back to place like say we have one in back of view and showing at though nearer and then it bounces back at that will
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_002 i have been learning about how to light a light bulb
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_001 i m good i am good how are you
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_003 a battery of light bulb and two wires
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_016 it is flowing though left to way like it goes drine and then it goes down then or it is going around
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_020 it is flowing towards the light bulb
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_012 will say we had a dark world then some one invades light bulbs then we could see we are going and then we don t have to worry about anything else where we could fall in crashing probably break a bulb
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_008 it means like it s a pathway to get to the light bulb with the energy in the wires
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_007 they on do they sender like the battery it has energy when the battery get hooked took to the wires and it touches light bulb the light bulb sends energy to the light bulb
myst_007081_2014-02-04_13-15-58_EE_1.1_021 electricity is flowing out of the d cell to get to the light bulb if electricity inflow out of the d cell then there will be no power in the light bulb
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_005 when the motor is moving i think it is send of electricity through the wires to on back to the positive sides to collect the energy and then going out to the motor give the motor energy
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_009 what is going on with the circuit because that you see how along the other picture it was on the end near the end of the thing the switch is near they flag like i say with the whole thing like there then no one this was got closer middle then it is switch to make the electricty flows into wires to the motor
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_018 if the flourish turning then it means that its collecting energy form the solar power to make it work
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_023 the flag is the motor is running
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_025 what i know this is the flag is not moving
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_020 it won t work and if it doesn t work then how would you make this motor work
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_010 the flag stops moving and it will not work
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_003 the wires goes to collects energy from the battery which i mean the battery would like how the energy so then the energy is goes through the wires into the motor to make it work
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_024 does the motor doesn t work anymore because any the motor the source on these lights see on the wires are connected to the motor from the source cell it needs takes it needs role lights a right now we have right but its stand enough light we need so and so like it s so bright
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_017 has to be like this is the solar power in this cell how has it wires kept away so we did have the wires up to the motor from the solar power then there is the solar power clip see together energy but i if we doesn t collect heat go to the motor then then they won t work anymore so that s
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_015 they re all bulb collecting solar power like see you know we have there s big solar solar powers on top of our houses to click channels this is what its kind of like but it collects heat in order to work and it s in difficult heat it s give electricity
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_004 the only way to make the motor one is a energy if like if the battery we know the energy then the flat which stop spinning in then the motor when it run
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_007 resend the battery sending of electricity to the motor to make it the flag spin if the flag doesn t spin that mean do have the battery either wires hooked up broke
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_013 the way i m send you know right now the switch is on the drive which is a moving make in the move but if i click its then all this if you now figures to the left to me then i would start come meet the fire move move move
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_011 i think the switch has to get closer to the middle has to be closed to make the electricity flow to the wires like see if the middle touch is the middle like goes through the wires into the motor
myst_007081_2014-02-11_12-11-00_EE_1.2_006 the d cell to make it work if there was in a d cell then now the motor run
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_023 hi observe that there is one light one d cell there is light like object dim and then you on a not on the right picture there s a light bulb and then used to light bulbs and one light bulb gets took in a way and then put back makes brighter
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_014 and a series circuit has the flow through the light bulb for flow flow through the d cell to the wires with any then the series circuit the series circuit not work er
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_004 a circuit is all about like one battery collect connects to connect to a wire like the battery has a two wires on the end of each one on the negative side one on the and one light bulb one touch in the bottom one touch in the side to make the light bulb light
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_005 the as making get a circuit is that there s one wire kept up to the positive side kept up to the bottom and ones kept up to the negative side to the side of the light bulb to make the light bulb shine bright
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_009 where the moving in electricity and all like bulb is that d cell collects energy for the source was all its source of them and because to the light bulb and then light they collect the energy goes to the negative side and going to the positive side
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_007 i do not completely no
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_026 discovered that if you click on one d cell the positive side is touching the negative side so then its going to the positive side after negative side due to positive side out the negative side
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_017 there are two pathways two actually two pathways because there is one connecting to the bottom one connecting to the side and one connecting to the other
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_012 what s up the blue dots moving is there think there re collecting energy from the battery then going through the battery collecting it going out the negative side
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_013 it connects my thinking because the wires use and collect energy from the light bulb in the d cell and d cell gives the wires energy to going to the light bulb
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_003 about if you do have a parallel circuit then have a series circuit which no one a series circuit one of those two parallel circuit make if like brighter
myst_007081_2014-03-18_11-28-32_EE_2.1_010 it is glowing is flowing through the battery and if them like series with open a battery then all be like have electricity like in the picture right now but then it goes it goes up the path negative side and goes into the positive side
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_005 it allows the battery because the battery wasn t there and how would the wires work so how would it work anyway
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_012 but i think but i think is going on is i have the motor is not running then you know you don t use started up wrong in you do have the right material make the motor run
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_002 we ve been learning about ah satellite dishes to make a motor work and what we did of movie how did ah satellite dish up to the sun the motor when in then only put a down the motors stacked and when the cloud blocked then its stopped
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_003 can you please ask the question again
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_017 the motor what happens to the motor is doesn t run
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_001 good how are you
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_016 can you please repeat that i ve knowing little kid right right now around in is being is stuck and smack so can you please repeat that
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_021 i notice that everything metal works except the sponge the work stick in the straw in the sponge don t work
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_007 and them wires is going on is that if the paperclip is it there then it wouldn t work and they if you can do others stuff like watch or trying to sponge and this it what happens
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_014 can you repeat a question again
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_015 can you please repeat that
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_019 they are making the motor run
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_004 what i noticed about the circuit is it just the same but would the little switch in the metal the metal then metal nail is touching the hm wires so there is so creating electricity it goes through wires in the all the way to the flag in it makes energy it passes energy through
myst_007081_2014-02-28_12-55-13_EE_1.3_018 please repeat that
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-51-32_EE_4.2_011 pleas leave me alone
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-51-32_EE_4.2_006 it needs a full circuit battery so it will work
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-51-32_EE_4.2_013 it rates the strength of because it is sending magnetism to it
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-51-32_EE_4.2_002 not really how are you
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-51-32_EE_4.2_005 it needs a wire a d cell a battery a d cell a magnet a steel revert a switch
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-51-32_EE_4.2_004 the set up is that you have to poop your pants
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-33-13_EE_3.3_012 what makes me she that is because i tried with the magnet and the paper clip and broke i broke that up to another paper clip which i like attract
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-33-13_EE_3.3_014 okay which the magnet is sending a magnetism through the nail to pick up others stuff okay
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-33-13_EE_3.3_013 magnet what i discovered about the magnet and the nail the magnet has like twisted it repel together and the nail has steel or iron in its so bring your own and i want to go finsh this sessions
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-33-13_EE_3.3_003 well they it s the way for its stick or attract is if there is iron or steel in that thing you are putting it on she got a node if there is iron or steel like has iron an or steel in it so attract
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-33-13_EE_3.3_011 the magnet is attracting to steel nail which is the steel is has the magnetism side and then it look at up to a paper clip so then it goes it just attracts it because they has magnet is the main
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-33-13_EE_3.3_016 if you just a name if you like have the magnet on the nail for a long time there was the magnetism must stands inside the nail then you can remove the magnet and then you put the nail on to the paper clip it attracts the paper clip
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-33-13_EE_3.3_002 what we been doing in science is that so learned about magnet and what they stick to
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-33-13_EE_3.3_007 it s moving itself because it is north and south the table glass are putting them i need to put them one magnet on top one magnet on bottom of it then you move the magnet bottom magnet where you want that bottom magnet will move the top one the way you are moving it
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-23-11_EE_3.2_001 good how are you
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-23-11_EE_3.2_012 pics this pics is all about a north and south north is on top and south is on bottom so that s how does so i give you which node if you have bring south over to north their attract in pole together
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-23-11_EE_3.2_009 they are facing south and south are facing each other s and north and north are facing each others are repel
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-23-11_EE_3.2_008 what s gone on like there is a north and south are facing each other so they attract a north and north is facing each other it s a repel a south and south are facing each other was so repel and then south and north are facing each other was also attract
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-23-11_EE_3.2_007 i think that because i learnt it
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-23-11_EE_3.2_006 what s gone on near there is a north and north facing each other so its pushing away because if you have two facing things facing each other than no push the repel
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-23-11_EE_3.2_014 if functions by the sun of the earth the sun of the earth is like a magnet so you walking it like push the way you going so that s the way you know you going like top is north bottom is south left is rest and right is south
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-23-11_EE_3.2_005 what would happen in that and
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_005 a magnet could attract anything that has iron or steel in it and it could connect to a creative magnets to those long free magnet you have north and south touching because our track been north and north would just repel it and push away
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_015 but it goes have to do it sticking to a magnet is at all a magnet only attracts iron and steel
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_019 okay all thing get stick to a magnet is a black rock a steel nail a paper clip and a plastic chip not a plastic chip but it s a plastic chip that steel and aluminum
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_012 why the wood block is attracting is because it doesn t have steel or iron in it just has wood but the magnet is not attract to wood
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_007 a has iron and steel in it so attract every type of magnet what the
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_016 what s in the metal is it like tiny bits iron or steel so it helps its stick
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_014 the other the one that is skinner and lighter is made out of steel iron but the plan correct but the right one is heavier and is made of steel or iron
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_011 a magnet has a north and south which if you had north and south facing each other like have two magnets have one north and south have a north and south come together and there just like comes together
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_001 good how are you
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_009 one name is say that is because one day we did on my experiment on man so see would they will attractive so that s what i know
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_022 it is true the paper clips made up iron or steel
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_010 they would block is non attracting to the magnet but the steel nail is attract each in the magnet because there steel inside
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-09-06_EE_3.1_004 well i assured about magnets and that is that take a stick to anything that has iron or steel in it
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_003 it s an important because if they you know how lights the collect energy form the electricity bulb we don t have any any of energy then we won t have an any light in our screw metal we just a page black place
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_025 i don t know anything about that
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_015 what is happening is that the guy is using sound energy with his palm state room dangerous to make a to make a make sound
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_006 energy is an important because if you breaking a lights they won t turn on without an energy or electricity
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_021 it turned into smoke
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_031 the coal fire are different from the solar panel because solar panel just makes it justine in the coal and fire sendoff smoke
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_026 there s some other boy they both collect energy like disclosure circle energy to make the motor run in the choose this no one mail collects energy by giving us electricity do watch tv car people in the phone
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_008 what s happening with the candles that the wax is melting from the fire and the stick somewhat a flame is going it s getting its getting longer
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_009 i observed is that the candle is melting down from the see and they every time heat get harder like melt all the way down and wax is down melting then the fire wood go out
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_027 they both collect energy
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_028 they are some other because able give up fuel like fire and stuff and smoke
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_014 i can see that the flame is moving back and forward for slowly
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_030 coal and gas are make a fire
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_011 it gives off heats and my
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_017 i think what s going on there is gets is eating there apple to get herself energy if she eat apples have any energy
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_007 i don t know anything about fuel
myst_007081_2014-03-18_07-19-21_EE_1.4_002 we ve been trying to figure out what would make two light bulbs to light with one battery
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-45-21_EE_4.1_008 what s about that i hate you and bye
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-45-21_EE_4.1_007 the cells all about what the two wires hooked up to the one side of the d cell and a switch and the another one hooked up to the other one wrapped them around there lives still rivet and went upto this d cell and then hooked upto the switch and they all collect washer
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-45-21_EE_4.1_005 wrapping the code with wires will make all like electricity with the magnet go through and break up the washers
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-45-21_EE_4.1_003 which is about is that you have we have to see what a magnetic will attract
myst_007081_2014-04-24_09-45-21_EE_4.1_006 and makes me see that because i tested it out
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_022 the black rock either green rock because green rock i don t think it will stick but the black rock i think so because has the same thing not in the ocean that stick to magnet
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_019 one is steel what the other is iron i guess
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_015 the magnet is not sticking to the wood because there is no magnet in it
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_024 it connected and its did
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_007 that is called magnetism
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_005 and note for them to connect together they have to be the opposite like not dissolve
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_017 repeat that again
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_025 because it has a same metal in it
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_027 we talked at and things that stick till on magnet spilling about irion tell me about iron and why just this stick to refrigerator and how magnets are used
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_014 because they did project
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_021 the paper these on the steel nail and the black rock
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_008 it has just it kind of metal in it
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_004 magnets is magnetisms
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_026 it might have the same thing has black rock does
myst_008041_2014-04-18_09-24-26_EE_3.1_020 i think it s aluminum
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_007 it is a reflection off of the light for it to a prism
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_042 because it is not the same color
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_038 it is not used to the color cause it says green and it is supposed to be green not red or blue
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_015 the light is reflecting off of the ball
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_035 well what happens is it turns dark green because when you mix up yellow with blue yeah it does that but when the car gets white it does not it turns blue
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_009 when the light turns on it reflects off
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_039 because it is that is the color it is used to
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_026 says the light is because of the
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_005 gives off light green and orange but you could only use the light
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_040 it will not go because it says red supposed to be red
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_037 it will turn dark
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_027 it because it is reflecting off and turning into a different color and it is different because it is changing into yellow instead of blue
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_003 they all have light
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_017 turning into something i do not know
myst_008041_2014-05-12_10-16-47_EE_5.2_006 by how it reflects off to make these kind of colors like to violet to purple to blue to green to yellow to orange to red
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_018 when we add more bulbs the light gets weaker
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_017 i think what was happen is it will show no way and no way not like really really bright like if you connect the battery with battery put that
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_006 it s important because electricity goes through
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_005 i think go i has to happen is the wires need to be connected to the d cell battery and it has both of wires has to be on a faing wire and casing wire
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_003 as circuit is all about electricity going through it
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_019 they get the energy it will not work because it really light
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_022 i think the by effected by getting brighter and brighter
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_014 it shows me the electricity flows where the battery there light bulb
myst_008041_2014-04-10_09-51-04_EE_2.1_027 can you repeat that again
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_017 what you would do if you wanted to make your electronic have more batteries facing positive to negative
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_016 when i minus the line to seven i mean 101s i did not notice that before i only picked up three and now i just picked up five
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_005 when it is a closed circuit it it connects the washers connect to it when it is an open circuit it does not
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_018 in case when i do that it picks up to lower cause when i put it up to thirty it picked up at least wait when i put it to a one hundred winds at least picked up thirty wash
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_014 when you increase the amount of batteries like like the like when i wrapped around a one hundred winds it picked up thirty washers cause i had the two batteries
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_009 what i discovered is when i put more wrap more of the wire around it it more washers stick to it
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_020 this is all about how two d cells work with a various one d cell and how much energy it gives or goes up to
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_007 well the more you wrap it around the more electricity and energy it gets forced
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_019 repeat that again please
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_006 we accomplished that by wrapped the wire more around the rivet
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_013 what it relates is
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_012 the more lines you have what is happening at the strength is it is getting more force into it
myst_008041_2014-05-01_09-30-23_EE_4.2_004 what is important is there is not supposed to be any open circuits all it has to be a closed circuit everything
myst_008041_2014-04-17_10-09-04_EE_2.3_015 it may be like this because the wire in order to make a connect into line the
myst_008041_2014-04-17_10-09-04_EE_2.3_021 what i think more happens is electricity goes stop flowing through and light bulb is stop stop lighting up
myst_008041_2014-04-17_10-09-04_EE_2.3_023 what is being shown is there replace the battery with different new one
myst_008041_2014-04-17_10-09-04_EE_2.3_001 not so great
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_015 well when the switch is off the when it is pushed outward nothing sticks to it but when it is switched in it sticks to something
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_030 makes me think that is because the wire or the electricity is going through it on to the switch and then it s going through the wire makes it to give it the magnetic force
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_026 the role of an electromagnet is the force of the circuit is so
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_009 what important is for the electricity and the spark go through the front because if you put it at the way back it won t be able to get through to get the magnet
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_018 the electricity does goes through and the magnetic force of the force all the washers connect and it goes through the positive side through out the negative side
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_006 the wire the rivet the wire is wrapped around the top front because that is where the the electricity and the energy can go through
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_007 could you repeat that
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_019 means it already has closed circuit the magnetic force is able to connect with the washers and the washers will connect when it is open
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_023 well when it is open circuit washers do not stick to the the metal thing and then when it is closed circuit it sticks
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_029 it s going through the wire
myst_008041_2014-04-30_13-36-16_EE_4.1_010 that is all about the magnetic force
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_005 we put washers in one cup and then we put magnets in another cup to see there how many washers will break or the magnets fall
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_020 by its force
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_024 when they get further apart the force goes weaker because there is the other magnet is magnetism force of the force is not connected to it which makes it weaker
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_016 the force of the magnet is but you are not supposed to have that much because the magnet will not want to connect
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_012 well what it does it makes the mag ah makes it the magnet taller that helps it makes it even
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_014 when i just added one washer it broke its fall because of the ah because of the spacers
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_010 what is going on here when i press spacers when i add them the magnet gets taller but the magnet touching each other
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_017 what it does is it makes the force weaker
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_022 it goes bigger and then it goes smaller
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_009 as i am when it got up ah to how many washers it could go up to the it broke the
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_021 i needed three
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_015 it is when you barely add one spacers it breaks its fall like that because the magnetism is not really there to stick on
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_007 on the left side is two magnets
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_006 the first was not the strong enough
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_004 the magnet that magent is is under the stack and you are just moving the magnet and the paper clip has now magnetism connected to it
myst_008041_2014-04-28_09-21-18_EE_3.4_023 what it does is it makes the force kind of weaker and weaker and weaker instead of being strong the force
myst_008041_2014-04-23_08-45-23_EE_3.2_008 what is similar is this sides to connect
myst_008041_2014-04-23_08-45-23_EE_3.2_006 i think that because is second part of it
myst_008041_2014-04-23_08-45-23_EE_3.2_004 i think it would not connect because the same quadrant
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_021 what is happening is that when the light is reflecting off different mirrors and it is setting to the star
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_020 repeat that again
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_022 it will eventually hit the star right here
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_023 the pencil is in a cup of water
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_009 like a mirror cause sometimes reflect it and go to the center something like that
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_018 because of the light reflecting off which gives it him so he can see himself of his reflection
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_008 whether reflective how it reacts
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_007 the guy he flick the switch to turn on and off the light
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_014 it bounces off it reflects to another thing
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_005 by how the different reflections there are where they are able to see it shine brighter
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_019 she is reflecting in the sunlight too in the mirror and it shows it on the wall
myst_008041_2014-05-06_09-21-32_EE_5.1_012 they bounce off it reflect to other stuff
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_022 what i can say about that is it is the any time the magnet is on it it reacts like
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_032 we ve learned about how magnets react how it could the force of the magnet is so it is so strong that it can go through a nail and holds a paperclip
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_028 when it is the magnet on it it can stick to the paperclip when it s not it cannot stick to the paperclip
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_023 going on where it just is the same thing you were showing me last time
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_010 under a table that is kind of word paper clip paper anything really
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_027 all i see is a magnet in a nail and it s keep on going on to the magnet that is all i see
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_011 i have noticed is when it is less than one s like when it is just one piece of paper the magnet can hold the paper clip
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_017 that it is like i saw those ones where if you like rub something metal on the magnet and stick it to a paperclip it will stay on because it force of it
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_009 what is happening is the force a stuff go through what because the magnet were so like is so strong
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_029 what is happening is the magnet does not off and because it is a magnet it is making it
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_008 the force is able hold it together in order a make move under stuff
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_019 acting like a magnet like a wire you can wrap it around electricity going through and just make it stick to anything like a metal and it acts like a metal
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_015 what is going on with the six piece papers is the force of the blue cannot go through because it is now thick and that then because it
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_031 i think what it is trying is the force of the magnetism
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_021 the magnet is reversed from the nail and the nail loses its magnetism
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_012 it is because the magnetism cannot go through a bunch of papers so it can not go through so it s not going through paper clip but that is for
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_014 it relates to magnetism by force of the magnet makes it through and then it just really really really keys
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_005 the magnet and the paper clip cannot repel ecah other
myst_008041_2014-04-25_09-43-33_EE_3.3_024 what do you mean i see the same picture
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_017 well since the ice is cold and if it turns into water first it will be get a little more colder then get warmer because the ice it gets melted
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 we were trying to figure out which was the coldest and which was the medium and which was the hottest i mean warmest
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 you can measure the temperature of the sun which you will need well an electrical thermometer and we can also measure water temperature air temperature well kind of like that
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 when when the water was in room temperature it was room temperature and and then it
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 well first it was at twenty degrees then it dropped to five degrees then it eventually went up
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_029 boiling is very very hot
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 well observations are when you look at things and make graphs and charts about the things and you can get more information about it
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_015 well when is well when the water was in room temperature and and oth
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026 well the the most the white one is fifty-five the next one is one hundred and the next one is five degrees and then the last one is twenty degrees
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_028 ten thousand, one hundred degrees is boiling point so the water will be boiling
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_019 well if it gets much more hotter and if it had much more time maybe go up back to room temperature which is about twenty degrees then it might drop again well then up then down well you will never know what the temperature might go
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 we read the thermometer on the line and where the red alcohol or mercury but alcohol is mainly used in schools because mercury is toxic and then you look at where the alcohol alcohol is and then you can and then you look at the line and you can tell which what temperature it is
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 temperature is how hot it is or how cold it
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_010 our celsius is well it is used in every single country but fahrenheit it is only used in the united states but united states also use celsius because it is more exact than fahrenheit
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 i like science very much and science is my favorite learning subject
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 robert is inserting one of his fingers into the cup b
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_020 use the dots and lines and and you can get the amount in a way that you can actually understand very well
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 well we had these cups a b and c and we were trying to find the temperature without f we were first trying to figure out the temperature with our fingers
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012 well a since it is room temperature and if you keep it in the room it will stay about the same but b it has ice cubes in it so it will eventually melt in a few hours
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_030 well the freezing point is when the water freezes which is about zero degrees and less and a little bit zero about one to four degrees ab i mean one to five degrees above zero degrees is getting by to freezing point so it is very cold
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_031 usually it is well maybe it will take time for zero degrees to get freezing but if it is like ten degrees it will take about two to three minutes to freeze
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013 these two thermometers represent the start and the finish and the start is twenty degrees celsius and the finish is z zero degree celsius
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_002 we have been measuring temperatures length capacity and masses
myst_999466_2009-17-12_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 we put dots and well first we meas measured the temperature then we put the dot on the minute and time and then we connected the lines with straight w we connected the dots with straight lines
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-44-43_MX_2.4_004 it will float
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-44-43_MX_2.4_007 that the cube in solution a is more less dense than solution is square
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-44-43_MX_2.4_002 so today we worked on how concentrated things might be like how concentrated fruit punch might be
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-44-43_MX_2.4_003 the cork is more dense than the penny
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-44-43_MX_2.4_005 it will float
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_008 my prediction was correct it the one the solution on the right did and was heavier and because it had more solute in it
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_002 we have been working on how concentrated water can get when you add concentrated powder
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_016 i will not miss you
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_014 the most concentrated solution is number one and the most diluted is number twenty
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_009 because the seventy-five milliliter cup has twenty grams of solute in it and the other solution has ten grams of solute in it
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_015 number b i guess
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_010 because when the solute dissolves it never really goes away it stays twenty grams and ten grams even when it is dissolved
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_012 you weigh them
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_007 the solution on the right will be heavier than the solution on the left because it has the solution on the right has more solute in it
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_003 you can tell because maybe one cup of water that is more concentrated might have maybe darker or lighter than the other
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_011 the last grape drink mix is the more the most concentrated because it is darker than the others
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_005 the feather is lighter and the rock is heavier
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_006 the solution on the right will be more concentrated than the solution on the left because it has more solute in it
myst_014028_2014-01-13_13-47-56_MX_2.2_013 number two is the least concentrated and number two is the most concentrated
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_025 you can do that in a mixture
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_015 that when you mix the mass of a solute and a solution you get the ending mass
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_040 you could eat it
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_030 it means that it was a mixture when we started
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_027 i do not know
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_006 the salt is a mixture and the sand and water is a solution
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_035 you might use evaporation
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_021 conservation of mass
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_039 well when the water goes up into the sky the salt is not it does not evaporate with the water so when the water evaporates the salt crystals reform into a different kind of form
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_041 some salt crystals are left and that is important because when the water evaporates salt does not evaporate because it does not have any water properties in
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_023 so you put the flour into the coffee thing and then the water went through the bottom but the bleach thing did not
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_037 the evaporation when when water evaporates it goes up into the sky
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_034 it is actually a solution
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_029 it is a mixture
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_002 we have been learning about separating solutions
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_036 the water is evaporating and leaving the salt crystals behind
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_026 the salt stayed in the paper and then the water went through
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_014 when you add the masses together they equal the end result
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_011 the salt is the solvent solute and the water is the solvent
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_038 it goes up into the sky
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_017 ten grams of candy twenty grams of raisin twenty grams of nuts equals fifty grams grams of trail mix
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_042 i noticed that the water is evaporating marni yeah and then the salt stays behind and forms a salt crystal
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_009 the salt will dissolve into the water
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_022 one way is to take a cup of water which has marbles in it and then take a screen and then screen the water through and then the marbles with stay on top
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_005 the sand is a solution and the salt is not
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_032 the citric acid stayed in the paper and then the water filtered through
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_018 no mass is lost or gained in this process
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_003 that the salt dissolves and the sand does not
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_013 grams of water fifteen grams of salt equals sixty-five grams of salt water
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-52-35_MX_1.2_008 i believe the role the water playing is a solute
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_012 they are the same as they were before
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_013 the animation is not work
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_018 they are not mixtures anymore
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_005 they are all mixtures
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_010 they get separated
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_016 the marbles stayed
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_006 can you give me a hint
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_014 the water leaked through the thing and the marble stayed on top
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_003 they are all mixtures
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_009 the salt and water is a solution
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_020 the salt disappears
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_004 they are all mixtures
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_008 the left pile is separated
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_015 the water went through and the marbles did not
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_002 we have been learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014028_2013-12-13_08-33-24_MX_1.1_017 it is important because salt disappears in water
myst_014028_2013-12-16_14-12-43_MX_1.3_004 the property of magnetism
myst_014028_2013-12-16_14-12-43_MX_1.3_003 evaporation is one way to separate mixtures
myst_014028_2013-12-16_14-12-43_MX_1.3_002 in school we did an experiment where we put gravel and powder and salt and magnetized rock in one cup and we tried to separate them
myst_014028_2013-12-16_14-12-43_MX_1.3_001 i am wonderful how are you marney
myst_014028_2013-12-16_14-12-43_MX_1.3_005 the paper clips are getting extracted from the dry mixture by the property of magnetism
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_010 there is more powder in the glass on the left right i mean i meant to
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_008 there is a lot more powder in the glass on the left she is not saying anything zero she is on
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_003 you pour one liquid into another solute
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_023 you take away some of the
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_015 because the lighter colors has have less concentration in them
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_006 one water might be a different color than another
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_009 the glass on the right has a darker color
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_016 more sugary and stuff like that
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_019 it has less flavoring in it
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_020 by adding water
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_001 good how are you
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_011 the mass of the concentrated water
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_021 you take away from the solution
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_012 the color and the mass
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_002 we have been talking about separating mixtures and solution
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_022 you take away some solution
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_017 the more concentrated grape drink would taste more concentrated than the one with fifty milliliters of water and one spoon one spoonful of drink mix
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_013 they are more concentrated than the rest
myst_014028_2013-12-17_12-30-07_MX_2.1_007 the glass on the right has more solution in it
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_012 the candy the peanuts and the raisins are all in separate piles now
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_014 the water went through the sift and the marbles did not
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_020 the salt dissolves the wood and paper chips do not do anything and the sand and water the sand settles on the bottom and the water stays on top
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_024 if you just put if you put the salt into the water it will dissolve
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_015 they are being separated in a very convenient way
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_013 they are separated and it is important cause it is being separated
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_005 the salad is a mixture and wood chips wood chips no that will not work she will not understand what you are saying
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_022 one example is sugar into tea and salt into water and when something dissolves it usually comes back in a different form
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_002 we have been learning about mixtures and solution
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_017 the sand stayed in the filter and the water came out clear
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_026 the salt will get dissolved into the water and that is it
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_018 again particle size because the sand is bigger than the holes in the in the coffee thing and so the the it did not go through so the water the water went through
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_016 particle size is the key thing here so the marbles are bigger than the holes in the screen so they will not go through
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_008 the right pile is separated
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_003 they are all mixtures
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_004 salad mixture and everything else but the water
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_021 the salt dissolves
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_030 i love you
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_011 they are separated all the
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_019 okay so again with particle size the sand is bigger than the holes in the coffee cup thing and so the sand stayed in the paper and then the water went through
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_001 i am so good
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_029 it is difficult to get back but it is definitely possible
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_028 i think it is definitely possible for you to get back the grape juice i think you just have to wait for the water to evaporate and then you can probably pour the grape stuff back into the can
myst_014028_2013-12-16_13-37-19_MX_1.1_007 the pile on the left is separated
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_020 because is one is more dense than the other and if you put them in the incorrect order they will sink i mean they will mix
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_002 well a mixture is a mixture and a solution is a solution
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_009 solution a will be more saturated than
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_003 the cork is less dense than the penny and that is why the water is carrying
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_001 i am good how are you
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_014 solution b is more dense so it will sink to the bottom but solution a is more dense so it will rise to the top
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_018 one put solution a on the bottom and solution b on the top
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_012 the less concentrated solution will rise to the top and the more concentrated solution will sink to the bottom
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_011 solution b is more saturated than solution a because when you put salt into water the salt will not always dissolve
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_004 an object that is less dense will float instead of sink
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_008 one glass of water might be more concentrated than another or more what was that word we used yesterday
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_016 it will layer on on the very top
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_010 if a liquid is more concentrated if it is more likely when you drop something it it will float
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_015 the less dense will rise to the top and the more dense will sink to the bottom
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_013 solution b that has sixteen grams of salt will sink to the bottom but solution a with only six grams of salt will rise to the top of the graduated cylinder
myst_014028_2014-01-28_12-33-14_MX_2.4_019 because the lighter solution is less dense so it will float on top instead they put it on the bottom so that is why they mix together and the other one is denser so it would rise to the top but it is still mixing
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_003 we have been learning about saturation in liquids
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_009 you may need different amounts to saturate certain grams of water but for the salt it does not take that many grams to to saturate some water and gavin looks like
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_005 because maybe one maybe one maybe the sugar is less saturated than the citric
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_012 twelve grams i mean substance three
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_007 so each substance has different different amounts of water so it will take more more sugar to saturated the it is jar of water less epsom salt to saturate it is jar of water and a little bit more of citric acid to saturate it is jar of water
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_004 with citric acid more citric acid is on the bottom of the container because the the liquid is as saturated as it can get
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_010 the sugar is the most saturated and i am going to kill mason right now
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_013 when you evaporate the citric acid epsom salt and regular salt the crystals may form different patter
myst_014028_2014-02-03_13-38-05_MX_3.2_006 that the sugar is more saturated than another other substance because the epsom salt is the less saturated and the sugar is the most saturated
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_015 needs nutrients to survive
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_007 i think the cells are the yeast
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_010 showing us how food how the plants food is produced
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_016 it shows a can with a tomato on it
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_020 so they can get food from photosynthesis
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_026 it has all three things it needs to survive so it is growing quite nicely
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_019 they do it by photosynthesis
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_028 eventually the energy from the plants comes up to hawks eagles and other things like that
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_017 there is a house and plants how nice
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_018 it shows how photosynthesis works and what photosynthesis needs to work
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_022 have any air
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_005 i think they are trying to get yeast out of its dormant stage
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_029 the food chain
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_023 it crippled it and it is dying
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_003 it has to do with the yeast if yeast will grow
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_009 the unhealthy looking one was grown in the dark bag
myst_022219_2014-12-18_11-51-04_LS_2.1_021 the plant does not have enough sun

myst_022219_2014-12-01_11-39-49_LS_1.3_029 a carnivore or an herbivore
myst_022219_2014-12-01_11-39-49_LS_1.3_018 it is about what plants and animals eat
myst_022219_2014-12-01_11-39-49_LS_1.3_025 they eat meat or decaying meats and berries or berry
myst_022219_2014-12-01_11-39-49_LS_1.3_019 the deer and rabbit are herbivores
myst_022219_2014-12-01_11-39-49_LS_1.3_004 we have been learning about life cycles producers consumers and decomposers are all part of the life cycles
myst_022219_2014-12-01_11-39-49_LS_1.3_026 carnivores eat meat
myst_022219_2014-12-01_11-39-49_LS_1.3_007 the bacteria fungi pine tree and grass

myst_022219_2014-11-14_11-06-04_LS_1.1_011 it has lots of subsystems that make the whole earth work correctly
myst_022219_2014-11-14_11-06-04_LS_1.1_005 it has interacting parts that make the car work
myst_022219_2014-11-14_11-06-04_LS_1.1_019 this is the one of the ecosystems for forests this also shows a food chain
myst_022219_2014-11-14_11-06-04_LS_1.1_002 well we are just starting to learn about living systems
myst_022219_2014-11-14_11-06-04_LS_1.1_012 they interact together to make the earth like it is
myst_022219_2014-11-14_11-06-04_LS_1.1_010 some of the subsystems

myst_022219_2014-11-14_11-06-04_LS_1.1_009 has interacting parts that make the whole human body work
myst_022219_2014-11-14_11-06-04_LS_1.1_004 they all interact with parts of the system so they work so that the whole thing works blah
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_006 i noticed that the magnets are sticking to the fridge
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_008 the nail or the magnet is attracting to the nail because the nail is iron
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_027 first we talked about what we have been learning about in science and how why the magnets stick to every refrigerator and then we talked about hm what type of metal attracts to hm all metals that are iron or steel attract to them
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_026 i think the paper clip is attracted to the magnet because hm the paper clip is made of iron or steel
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_018 it is hm steel or iron that will hm attract to each the magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_015 magnets stick to anything that is iron or steel
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_010 the nail is sticking to the magnet because the magnet or the nail is steel or iron so the magnet attracts it
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_020 the nail that sticks to the magnet must be steel or iron youcopying me
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_013 only iron and steel mostly metals and stick to magnets
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_021 i think that the steel was stick to the magnet because aluminum is like not as just a strong
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_012 hm the magnet is not pulling is not attracting the wooden block because the block is into iron or steel so only the nail will attract to the magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_016 a nail must must be made of aluminum
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_014 its because the wooden block is not iron or steel and it doesn t have anything that can attract to a magnet so it won t attract
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_007 they are sticking to the refrigerator they are sticking to the fridge because hm the magnet attract to iron and the fridge is iron so it attracts to it
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_024 i think that the paper clip will stick to the magnet because it is made of iron or steel
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_003 there is a north pole and the south pole of the magnet and if you put two north poles together they won t attract and if you put two south poles together they wont attract
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_004 and hm only a north pole and south pole stick together
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_005 it is because the hm the fridge is made out of iron and the the magnets attract to iron
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_022 i noticed that only usually the metals on or objects will stick to the magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_002 we have been learning about magnets
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_019 magnets usually stick to iron or steel
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_023 i think it has steel or iron in it
myst_008045_2014-04-18_08-29-31_EE_3.1_017 its because the magnets only attracts or and kind of metals and the other nail must be aluminum so it s is not attracting to the magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_005 we know that right now where the reason open circuit because the energy it does not follow completely in one pathways because this the switch is open
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_021 and then the energy cannot flow anymore so it stops and then hm like there is no more energy for the power to go the next battery
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_015 connected just along the sides of the light bulbs and they just flow along through on the sides they do not goes into and then come back out the light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_010 you can use like something that will the energy flow through it that can complete the circuit
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_017 because i think that the energy stops flowing to that like light bulb so it doesn t keep flowing
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_023 this is a series circuit
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_004 we have been learning about the strings just like
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_008 then they like the energy just like the light just is like to broken
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_014 i think the light bulb is not lighting because the one light bulb that is in the middle is on it was burnt out so that s all the energy just stop because it couldn t it wasn t able to flow through
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_009 i am to use you can use something that is metal
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_019 the energy stops right there because the filament broke so the energy cannot keep flowing through the light
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_026 this happens and there is only one path way than the if there are more than one light bulb then the next light bulb will not get any energy because it is not open circuit because it is not connecting the filament
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_027 it will lights by hm because sense of the filament breaks on one and one battery and there is only path way and then it is non open circuit because the filament is not connect and that s what i think
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_013 that the energy just does need the energy still flows through that light bulb but it does not take any of the energy so the light bulb doesn t light so then it will go through the next light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_020 and so the filament breaks on one of either of the light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_011 know that in a series circuit that hm the energy just flows and it doesn t have to travel through each and every battery that it just flows along the sides of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_002 we have been learning about solving capitalized
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_018 the light bulb that is broken the filament is broken so the energy cannot keep flowing through the wire
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_022 it is because there is there are two different path ways so the light bulb on the right can get its own energy instead of having to suffer because there is only one path way and the energy stops
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_006 i think the bulb is not light up because it is in open pathways so the energy just stops and on the switch should energy has now ready go so it does not flow completely to the light bulb so the path it is not it is not getting enough energy from the and the negative side of the d cell
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_012 then the energy then the energy will just keep flowing through the light bulb and it will not work for it but the energy will flow through the next battery light bulb and then all next bulb will light up because it is not burnt out
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_007 when i clicked on the switch the light bulb light up because it is a complete circuit and the energy just just keeps flowing through and it is getting energy from the and the negative side of the battery instead of just it being an open circuit
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_025 this is a parallel circuit but hm it the other two light bulbs keep lighting because there are three different there are different path ways so then hm one light bulb doesn t have to suffer a filament breaks on one light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-52-39_EE_2.3_024 we have also seen we have been learning about parallel
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_019 if you add more wire wrap you are able to attract more washers
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_024 the things that are related are the on the on the they just have add more d cells see how many washers you are able to attract
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_002 that is it is not a combination of electricity and magnet
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_016 on the side of the graph that is how many washers you can attract so and it increases the more time you wrap the wire around the rivet
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_009 you can see that there is no washers attaching because it is not in a a closed
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_008 you can see that if you wrap the wire around the riven larger and you add and you have more winds that you are able to pick up more washers
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_004 the the wire is wrapped around the rivet and it attracts the washers
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_026 changes because there is more electricity flowing around the rivet and it is getting more energy so it is able to attract more washers
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_012 it does because there is a larger amount of electricity that is wrapping around the rivet
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_025 it effects it by the amount of electricity that is flowing around it so if there is more electricity it is able to attract more washers
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_011 can wrap it around the rivet larger and it will attract more washers because there is a stronger amount of power going through the rivet
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_005 it has to be an open circuit
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_007 you can see that the the electromagnet is able to attract more washers
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_010 you can notice if you wrap it around the rivet larger and if you add more d cells that you are able to attract more washer
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_003 you have to wrap the wiring around the magnet to make an electromagnet
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_021 that the electromagnet would attract fifteen washers because on eight thousand and ninety and a one hundred they all attract fifteen so in between ninety and a one hundred it has to be fifteen because if it is a one hundred it should attract more
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_020 it relates because if you add more wire wraps you are having more electricity go into the rivet and it makes it stronger so it is able to attract more washer
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_013 we we need to wrap around the wire larger and you need to add more d cells and it will be able to attract more washer
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_018 that is on the bottom it is how many time you wrap the wire around the rivet and on the left side it if how many washers it can pick up if you increase the wire wrap
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_015 you can see that on the bottom that it how many times you wrap the wire around to the rivet
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_014 this is showing you that if you wrap the wire around the rivet that you will be able to attract more washers
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_017 you label them to see how many of what or things that you have or how many of them
myst_008045_2014-05-01_08-37-34_EE_4.2_006 to make an electromagnet stronger you can wrap the wire around the rivet tighter or you can add more electricity
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_023 this shows me that am this shows me that other things can turn into temporary magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_003 were able to move iron field around and we can see that the north poles of the magnet is as strong as an the south pole and am were able to see that if we use iron field
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_002 we have been learning about am magnetic am fields
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_008 the magnetic is a they are attracting each other so that the steel nail is getting am like magnet powers and they am it is like getting the magnetic field of the magnet and it is traveling down the steel nail and it is am attracting the paper
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_012 think that the am it s different because the the donald magnet has a north and the south pole on the opposite side and the steel nail will just have it on the top and the bottom of it
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_005 the magnet am force is attracting each other so they follow each other round no matter where you move the magnets they still have a stronger enough force to attract through the table
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_010 they are attracting each other because the north pole and the south pole and they are north pole and south pole and they attract to each other
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_015 i think that the magnetism from the magnet is attracting to the steel nail and the steel nail becomes temporary magnet and it gets magnetism and it s a temporary magnet and it attracts the paper clip
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_006 if the distance between the magnets is stick then the magnets wont attract because they will have a strong enough am magnetic field to attract each to other and if it is then they can just attract easily
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_024 the steel nail is getting magnetism from the a donald magnet and it is attracting the paper clip to the steel nail am because the magnetism from the magnet am like kind of gives half magnetism into the steel nail and the steel nail becomes a temporary magnet and attract to the paper clip
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_009 i noticed that the steel nail is on getting like magnetic force from the magnet and it is traveling through the steel nail to attract the paper clip
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_013 then the magnet or the steel nail it s a magnetic force and it will lose its magnetic force so it will lose it little time and it will eventually drop the paper
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_019 what it is on because the magnetism from the steel nail it is loosing its magnetism from the magnet so it doesn t have any magnetism to attract the paper
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_022 that the blue stuff is showing magnetism from the magnet i think that the blue stuff is showing the magnetism so that they attract
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_016 the nail is a temporary magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_004 it will works by hm the magnet they got its name from a magnesia and hm it has a magnetic force to attract iron and steel
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_007 through that thick paper the magnetic field are strong and they will attract as well and on the thin pieces of the pieces of thin paper thin pieces of paper they might they can attract each other easily
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_017 the magnet is giving magnetism to the steel nail and the steel nail turns into a temporary magnet and attracts the paper clip
myst_008045_2014-04-25_08-27-06_EE_3.3_020 it is not sticking to the paper clip because the it is not it is not getting magnetism from the magnet so it looses its magnetism in a moment that attract the paper clip
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_004 is that the flag is moving and it is important and important because hm it is the its getting the electrons from the battery and electrons and electrons are traveling through the and negative side of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_019 it has to have light from the sun so that it will move because if there is not light it has no energy to travel through it to make the motor move
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_008 that it must get energy so it moves
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_014 i noticed that i don t
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_029 this picture is showing that the energy the electrons are traveling from the and the negative side of the battery into the motor so that it is getting energy because if there is only energy from the positive side better if the battery it will will not work
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_009 the battery is transferring its energy and then it moves so that
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_020 flag is turning it means that it is giving energy through the solar panel and the solar panel get its energies from the sun and energies like moves through the wires
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_027 start when there is no sun that the flag will not move
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_018 the solar panel is getting its energy from the sun and it is travel the electron are traveling through the wires which is producing energy so that it will make the motor move
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_017 their energy from the sun and they travel through wires to make the like the electrons would travel through the wires and they are all produce energy a negative energy from the sun
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_025 would you start when the sun is out that the motor will move because it is getting energy from the solar cell and the electrons should travel through the motor to the they travel from the d cell or the
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_012 noticed that the switch is not putting the other wire so it is an open circuit and the energy just stops so it doesn t do anything
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_013 you said that there is energy traveling from both the and the positive side of the battery so it travels up
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_007 think that the battery is loosing and its energy because it is giving hm its energy to the motor and the electrons are traveling through the wires
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_021 i think it is one point because it is saving
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_028 that there is no energy traveling from the d cell through the wires into the motor and then blabla blablabla
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_022 think that the solution would not work because it is in getting any energy from the sun will i think it will store work but it will not work is much because it is not getting as much brightness than sun from
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_002 in science we have done i am doing closed circuits and open circuits and how they work
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_024 the flag was start to move because it is getting energy through the solar cell and the energies moves then i goes
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_023 thinking it can still produce energy on a cloudy day i just think it will not be able to produce as much energy as on bright and sunny day
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_003 the motor is getting energy from the and negative side of the battery and they need energy from both sides to make the flag move and it is getting energy so it moves
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_010 that hm energy travels from the negative side of the battery straight into the motor and the positive side of the energy of the battery gives it energy and it travels to the switch and switch travels up the metal part of the switch ad it stops but if you connect it to the other wire the neutral makes the motor
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_005 it move it means that it is getting energy from the battery that it means to move
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_006 it must get energy from the battery so that it will move
myst_008045_2014-04-07_10-42-48_EE_1.2_015 that the energy has to be it has to be a closed circuit so that the energy can travel the electrons can travel through the wires and then the switch and then that will happen
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_024 i see different fuel sources i see good ones and bad one
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_033 nonrenewable energy sources are things that we will never have one day that we only have them now
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_003 because we need it to make stuff
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_018 i see a lot of sources of energy
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_031 they are different because solar panels are a lot better because they do not they do they do not they do not pollute bad gases into the air and make it worse while solar panels do not pollute bad gases in to the air
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_032 they will have bad bad effects on the environment because they pollute bad gases into the air and we breathe in that air
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_010 i see none
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_009 i see fuel
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_008 burning candle gives off energy
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_022 it is all dark and smokey
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_014 energy is happening because they are using they are using their energy from their body to pat the drum
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_023 i think that it will be better because we are not releasing bad gases and fuel into the air so that we will live a happy and better life
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_020 that the environment will be bad because we are releasing bad gases into the air and we breathe in that air
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_012 i see that the wax is getting smaller and smaller because it is fuel and it is getting used
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_013 you can see heat or you could feel heat
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_015 she is using energy because she is getting energy from her apple and then she is using energy on her walk
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_029 the gas and coal are different because coal is mostly not used for cars it is mostly used in factories and fuel is like used for gas and car
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_005 i do not know what fuels are
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_025 the other name is that we can never we do not have it forever that we will eventually one day run out of it
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_002 we have been about present energy
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_028 they are similar because they both do leave bad gases in the air and they they are both energy sources
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_016 you are using energy
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_011 no i do not hear anything when a candle burn
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_026 they are similar because they are both energy sources and they are not leaving bad gases in the air
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_006 a candle it is on fire and it relates to energy because if energy
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_017 yes you can hear the drums being played because they are an instrument and they are made to make noise
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_021 we it makes the air all it it gives off bad gases to the air and we breathe in that air
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_027 they both produce energy and they do not and neither of them produce bad gases into the air
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_030 i think that coal and gas will one day run out and we will not have anymore left to use
myst_008045_2014-04-09_08-27-39_EE_1.4_007 observe when i see it kind of burns i
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_002 in science we have been doing build we have been building parallel circuit
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_012 because you are getting more electrons to flow through the wires from the d cell because that if you add another d cell you will get more due
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_011 if you add another power source like a d cell then then you will get more power from the light bulbs
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_003 this is a parallel circuit because the two light bulbs are getting energy from one light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_007 notice that energy is going into the base of the battery and it comes back out the base of the battery and goes into the base of the other battery of the filament another casing wire and it goes into the next light bulb into the casing wire
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_010 compare differently because the brightness is different
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_018 in a parallel circuit the path there are two pathways or more it matters how many like will
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_013 they are different because in a parallel circuit they have to go through they go through the light bulb and they have to come up the side by in a series circuit they just run along the sides of the battery or light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_009 i observe energy is moving
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_015 i remember that is always goes like in one side and it comes out the other side
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_022 they are dimmer because there is only one pathway so the so the light bulb is getting come at the first light bulb that energy travels to is getting the most energy so the energy that it does not need there is only a little bit so it flows into the next battery
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_004 i notice that there is only one d cell battery
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_005 they are different because a series circuit it is not have to go through the light bulb well on a parallel circuit they only get one battery and they have to go directly through and come up the other side of the light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_014 i am working with series and parallel circuit
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_020 they are the same they are almost to same be because they are both in parallel circuits and the one the one in the top left is a series
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_016 it is it has two pathways and and it is not going it is going will clockwise and then when it comes out of the negative it goes can a clock or clockwise but still it is not the same
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_017 it goes backing to the d cell at the in the positive side of the d cell because the energy then electrons are coming out the negative side of the battery and it keeps flowing and the wire it follows the wires and the other wire goes into the positive side of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_006 i notice that the energy is coming out of the negative side of the d cell it goes into the base of the the light bulb because of the filament and comes out the casing wire and it goes back into the positive side of the d cell
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_021 because there there is there is only eleven pathway in the bottom and in the two top there two pathways and in the bottom the light are dimmer and in the top that the light are strongly because they have their own pathways
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_019 in the bottom right there are there are two pathways because there are two light bulbs and did not the bottom lifted it only there are only one there is only one pathway because there is only one light bulb so there is not another way for it to flow
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_023 i notice that they are both even the one with twenty-two light bulb is still they are both getting the same amount of energy inner in the bulbs
myst_008045_2014-04-17_08-40-01_EE_2.2_008 there are four pathways
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_025 color changed and if it is a different object then it will not change into that color if it is a certain color object
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_015 that every color is white is attracting to the yellow ball and yellow is reflecting off of the ball
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_014 all the the light is attracting to the yellow ball except the the color yellow the only color that is reflecting the ball is yellow
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_030 the color red because the brick is red
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_012 the white light is is different colors so all the colors attract the blue ball except for the color the light blue so it can transform into blue
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_019 since they put the red visor in front of the light it will turn on the other objects in front of it into red it because the light that is going towards it is red
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_024 because the two colors do not mix together
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_003 it can come from energy
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_010 can notice that in the light bulb all the colors are white and when it splits into the prism it splits into different color
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_002 we have been learning about how light is can split into different colors
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_007 see that the prism splits up the different splits up the different colors of the light
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_004 you can see that the white light makes the candle green because without the light it would not be any color
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_005 it is a light going into a prism and a prism splits up the different colors of the light and is all the different colors of the light
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_009 you can see that is splits into six different colors and it is the colors of the rainbow
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_028 cause it has to have every other color besides green to turn the light green
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_020 because you are changing the color of the light by putting the red visor in front of it because you are turning the light into red and then it the red light is making other objects in front of it turn into a different color
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_023 the yellow ball changes into a different color because different light is going towards
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_026 you think that only some colors light will change the color of the lime
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_016 that the white light is attracting the ball and the yellow light reflects off the yellow ball
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_029 you notice that only red light will make the brick light and green and blue will not it will still appear black if you use green
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_013 you can notice that when it is going towards the ball that it is white light and when it reflects the ball the light is blue that reflects
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_018 that the blue ball blue light would reflect it and on the yellow ball yellow light would reflect
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_011 i think that six different colors are included in the white light
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_021 you notice that different objects can turn into different colors depending on which color the object is
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_008 you notice that the prism you can see that the prism turns splits it up into different colors and you see that that the light is not just one color that it is many different colors
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_017 you notice that white hitting the ball and yellow light is bouncing off of the
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_027 cause the the colors are not the color of what the color the lime is and the they will not change the color of the lime
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_006 you notice that the prism splits the different colors of the light into different forms
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_022 color of what the object is would change to the color that is going toward
myst_008045_2014-05-12_08-48-13_EE_5.2_031 it is different because it does not need that color
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_004 found out that the brass ring works
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_008 with an insulator in it will not work because that in an insulator will not let energy flow through what travel through it
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_007 i notice that the motor is not spinning because the wooden stick is an insulator and it will not work because energy cannot flow through it
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_006 conductor in a circuit lets electricity flow through it if you have a close circuit and you put a an conductor in between excellent spot that is opened to make a close circuit it would it will lay electricity flow through it and it will work the motor was spin
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_011 conductors are object that are energy is able to flow through them with and the motor will still spin it is like having another wire
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_010 let start thus paper clip is a conductor and energy can is able to flow through
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_002 we have we have been learning about conductors and insulators
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_003 the conductors are things that will able to travel electricity through so that they was spread a part to let electricity flow through and insulators do not let any electricity travel through that
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_005 mostly you can use metal objects to make the motor spin or it has to be something that can move a part till the electricity flow through they have to be able to spread a part a little bit so electricity can flow through
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-49-56_EE_1.3_009 there is or anything that you can put in an a circuit so make the circuit a closed circuit and it will out of make the motor spin because the energy can flow through it
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_016 you can see that light is able to reflect off some objects better than others and and if it reflects off of that object the light is not able to travel further or as fast
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_004 you can not it reflects it can reflect and keep and can reflect onto something
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_018 cause the light is reflecting and it is bouncing back at the the student
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_005 the light is turning on and off and rays reflecting
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_024 you notice that the pencil reflects off the glass
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_019 i think that the student is reflecting the light and it is able to be making light because the sun is light a light source and it is bouncing off the mirror onto the side of the building so she can create light
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_015 you notice that it reflects different off of certain objects in the room and some objects are able to reflect light better and the light is able to travel further but some objects slow down the light
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_017 you observe the light reflect
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_012 it is called reflecting
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_010 you can notice that it travels further if it reflects off certain objects but if it bounces off other objects it is not able to travel as far
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_023 a pencil is reflecting because of the light so it looks like there is two pencils in the water but there really is only one
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_003 because it this light is reflecting
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_025 and the glass with water in it it is reflecting in the with the glass with air nothing is happening
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_022 i think the flashlight will hit the bottom left in the corner star because of how
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_021 the light the flashlight is giving off light and the mirror is reflecting it into another mirror and it is reflecting and it is not it is not strong enough to keep on traveling so it stops before it gets to the
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_009 i know that light reflects off of some things but some things it can not reflect off as well and it is not able to travel as
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_027 we talked about how different things can reflect and how light travels and if you position things in different ways you can make light travel in different ways and how how far it can go
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_006 without it everything would be dark
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_002 we have been learning about light and how it travels
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_013 some objects are able to reflect light better and make light travel further but some objects can slow down how fast the light is going
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_020 can keep reflecting if it is positioned right and the light is strong enough
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_014 it reflects off the objects that it hits in the room
myst_008045_2014-05-06_08-36-00_EE_5.1_007 it reflects off of some things but some things it can not reflect as well
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_011 i notice that on the circuit sent you put a board it is not able to conduct the electricity so it just turning to an open circuit and then the electricity flows off and it does not go to the motor that is why the motor can spinning
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_013 hum we are testing the which one was able to conduct the electricity and which one was in
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_005 when you add a conductor to a circuit it able to send the electricity into the battery or the motor or whatever here sending energy to
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_007 having conductors helps send electricity to the motor so then is able to spend the fly gram
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_015 when you add an insulator to the circuit it is the electricity is enable to flow through that wire in open circuit and because send it is an open circuit it is not able to flow electricity into the motor that is why it does not work
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_014 insulators and conductors are different because conductors are able to conduct electricity from the battery so then it powers whatever in its power but insulator it is doesn t let the electricity flow through that is why it does not give a power to the motors
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_003 on the left side of the circuit bolt there are certain things and you test the mouth by touching the switch into the metal part is checking while which relates over to the motor and then receive those spin
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_010 in a circuit a conductor conducts electricity to power a motor
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_017 i notice that the objects that do you let electricity flow through them or usually metal and because that they are conductors but they wants that are hard than spongy or plastic or wood then not able to conduct the electricity so then it creates an open circuit and that is why they runs late as
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_009 what happens to the motor when you put a conductor to it it able to take the electricity from the positive side and then it is able to use it to spin the fan or when you put a non conductor like the rock the sponge things like that it is not they would to collect the electricity from the positive side that is what does not spin when you do not have a conductor
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_016 conductors are work conduct electricity from the positive or the negative side so then against the motor power just been
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_012 sends you put an insulator that the electricity is unable to flow through it because when i tries to get through the sponge it does not give it any spaces to get through that is why the electricity is enable flow through the sponge and into the motor so when i can spin
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_008 i notice that one i put something metal on the wire and the switch it able to connect the electricity to the motor but when you put something that is not metal say spung it is not able to run to connect electricity so the fan dos not spin
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_006 when you add a conductor to the switch and the wire it creates a close circuit but when you do not have a conductor it becomes an open circuit because energy just flows the way not into the motor
myst_008045_2014-04-08_08-37-53_EE_1.3_002 i have been learning about conductors insulators and sounds like that
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_032 i think that because a magnets attracts iron and steel so that s why i think that am the wire has to be wrapped around wire or steel to become an electromagnet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_021 it will just start over again in the flow of electricity am and will keep going and if you open it and the energy will just stop
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_020 if it is an open circuit than the energy will just stop
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_028 you consider that the energy is flowing and it is giving am energy to the magnet to attract the washers
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_015 if you do not have one of the objects or things that you need you will not be able to create an electromagnet and so you will need both on objects to make an electromagnet and with that may be the energy will not be able to attract any of the washers
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_006 and you will need you will need energy and a magnet to make an electromagnet because with out one of the sources it is just an energy it is just energy or magnet am
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_004 am if the magnet that was into the electricity that you can transform a am temporary you can change something that in magnet can attract into a magnet so it becomes a temporary magnet but you have to have electricity
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_027 and because without the electricity the magnet isn t the magnet isnt strong enough to attract any of the washers so it will not be an electromagnet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_018 because if you do not have an a closed a closed circuit if you have an open circuit the flow of electricity stops and you are not able to complete the object you are trying to complete
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_012 you see that if it is an open circuit and it will not work it will not attract any of the washers because it is not getting any electricity because it is an open circuit
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_016 and all the energy it has to be flowing the on the same way and it has to be a closed circuit or else the energy will not am the energy will not help in this circuit because the energy just stops
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_002 we have been learning about electromagnet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_010 i think that is important because if you do not unwrap the wire around the rivet than am and you will not have any electricity and flowing through the magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_019 you will need a close circuit during the progress of the flow of electricity because am a switch is a conductor so energy is able to flow through it and if it s an open circuit the flow of energy will stop but if it s a closed circuit the energy will keep going until it is to back to the d cell
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_030 and the wires have to be close and against the rivet or else it will not work because the energy is not closed enough to the magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_025 the flow of electricity stops because there is no refrigerator electricity to go
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_014 you noticed that the energy stops arm around the rivet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_009 the wire is wrapped around the rivet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_011 i noticed that is a closed circuit and it includes the switch but it also has a d cell to have energy
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_005 it am it is like if we do not have the arm then we that it is not able to move and the magnet will not be strong enough to carry the car
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_024 you need a switch because with you don t have to have a switch and the circuit but if you have when you are able to turn it off and on because if on you will open the switch if you open the switch then it is an open circuit and the energy is able to flow close the switch energy and the switch is a conductor so energy is able to flow through it
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_022 and the energy stops and am that the magnet is not able to attract anything anymore
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_013 without the energy then it will not be an electromagnet magnet and the rivet will not attract any washer
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_008 if you don t wrap the wire around the magnet than and it will not attract anything to it because it will not be an electromagnet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_023 the washers am are able to attract to the magnetic because the washers are either steel or iron so they are able to attract to the magnet
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_026 i think that a temporary magnet just means that and it is like a magnet for a little because temporary temporary means for a certain amount of time for just a while and so i think the temporary magnet means that it s not really a magnet but it can be a magnet for a certain amount of time
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_031 i think that it has to be made of iron or steel so that it can attract the washers
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_003 an electromagnet is a magnet that has energy in it
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_007 without the energy it will not act like a magnet because the hm am it s not strong enough to carry all of the washers
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_029 and because energy is power so i think that the energy gives the am magnet and energy so that it is stronger to attract items
myst_008045_2014-04-30_12-07-18_EE_4.1_017 and you don t have to use a switch in this circuit but if you use this switch you can stop the progress of what it is doing because if you move the switch it will become an open circuit and the flow of energy stops and it is not able to do what did you supposed to
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_005 the magnets are repelling each other because they are either two north poles or south poles facing each other
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_008 they hm like run away from each other
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_003 they have a north pole and a south pole and if you put two south poles together or two north poles together they will like they stuck each other and they won t attract you have to put one north pole and south pole together
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_002 we have been learning about how magnets interact
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_011 i think this picture is the
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_007 the north pole and the south poles are attracting each other and the two south poles are repelling each other and the two north poles are repelling each other
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_010 and some of the magnets are attracting and the rest or repelling because the two of the same poles or repelling each other so only the two bottom poles are north and south poles then the rest are the hm the same pole as each other so they aa they are repelling each other
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_009 like the magnets are repelling each other and pushing away from each other
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_004 think that they will hm repel each other and they will not attract so then they just
myst_008045_2014-04-23_08-26-28_EE_3.2_012 she is trying to see which direction she is going
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_016 okay now work
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_003 a circuit is a series of wires that connects to a conductor a circuit is a series of wires and they get energy from a d cell and they travel through see the motor
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_011 just out the negative side of the battery and comes back into the positive it goes up to the filament comes down the basically to the other filament come down the basic goes into the the metal the wiring casing casing wire and it goes back into the positive sign
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_013 to my thinking because they are moving like and then they are like energy and energy moves throughout the world like when we talk there is sound waves coming out of by mouth
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_004 electricity circuit electricity flows
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_007 certain point because they only to be there to make a complete or a closed circuit if you not have one of the if we do not have one of these items we want to be able make a circuit out works
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_010 to electricity is flowing through the negative of the filament down the the the the basic wire to
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_012 blue dots moving or energy that is traveling through wires it is going into the casing wire it is going up to the filament and down the basing what the base of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_002 we have been doing building series circuits
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_022 are you lonely
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_015 so they move they go into the take the wire casing of the battery up into the filament and the energy that it does not need to power the light bulb goes down the base and goes back into the other wire and it goes to the other light bulb and then it goes into the positive side of the d cell
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_018 and more light bulbs the light bulb was will get dimmer
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_006 still get energy from both the and the negative of the light bulb where the d cell so that the light bulb will light
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_005 for the both to light the the wires at letting energy from the negative go into the they are light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_008 it is just giving energy and travels like a pass way and then i do not know
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_019 i think that we will get more the light bulbs will need more voltage and they will and the light bulbs will get brighter
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_017 in a series circuit pathways they can be as many as two up to is as many as one million
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_001 i am doing good
myst_008045_2014-04-10_08-31-30_EE_2.1_021 either the electricity is not flowing because you are getting energy from both sides of the negative of both of the d cells we need energy from the and the negative side of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_011 and the magnetic force they are still attracting to each other but like they can still attract but they do not the it doesn t have to attract and go down
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_007 if the magnetic force is not strong enough to hold nineteen washers so the magnetic they cannot attract anymore and they just loose each other
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_004 the magnets are not attracting because there is not the strong enough magnetic force to attract to each other
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_012 if you add too many spacers than the magnetic force gets weaker and am they are not able to attract so that washers is falling down because it is heavier
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_013 you can see that the magnetic force is weaker
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_008 the magnetic force is not strong enough to hold the magnet or washers that are in the b cup so the magnetic force loses each other
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_020 you will then you will only need it a little amount of washers to break the magnetic force because there is such a large distance between the magnets
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_021 the amount of washers that you need gets smaller
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_009 i noticed that the spacers are a conductor and they are still a lot they can still attract to them because am they attracted to those kind of things
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_002 we have been learning about magnetic force of magnets
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_006 in the a cup there is a magnet and they are trying to attract each other
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_015 if you add too many spacers the magnets are not able to attract an they can t because the balance balance is not it is not able to go it is not able to it is not able to add any more spacers in between
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_018 they do not have a strong enough force to attract because they are too far apart
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_014 you noticed that the magnet on top is a little bit of because the magnetic force is not as strong
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_016 they are able to attract to each other
myst_008045_2014-04-28_08-36-30_EE_3.4_003 the magnets can attract because there is not a large distance between them
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_028 i noticed that the light bulb is wrecking because it is getting energy from both the and the negative side of the d cell
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_012 so the battery gets it power and the light so the battery is like a light
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_026 it is flowing away from the negative side of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_004 we call them a d cell battery a battery and then energy required
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_002 in science we have been learning about light bulbs and other electricity and conducts and that all
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_027 i noticed that energy is produced from both the and the positive side and it makes the light bulb light because if you denied have one of the side touching that wouldn t work
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_023 i noticed that the energy is started to go the other way which is clockwise
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_013 receiver means is getting an object or something from anything
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_008 the d cell gives the wires energy so that the wire flows energy through the wire it self and it gives energy to light bulb to light
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_029 one it have to be connected to the electricity flow because the energy use to flow through them and if on the component or wrecking right and they won t flow through and we won t get energy to light up the bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_020 it flows to the d cell because the energy that it doesn t need for to produce light and the light bulb it gives back to the other wires and it comes back into the positive side of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_005 that the base of the battery if you connect the wire to the base of the battery then connected to hm to the top of the d to the negative of the d cell battery and the positive of the d cell battery then it will make the light bulb turn on
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_019 hm the energy travels is just traveling counter clockwise and then it goes from out of the battery because the energy is the energy from the battery is letting of its energy and it goes through the wires and touches the battery and the battery or the light bulb produces light and it comes and then the energy that did all need comes back down and goes back in and they get more energy back
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_009 the wires and the circuit travel energy through them to give power to an object that it is touching
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_007 batteries a forty-seven a sixty produce energy so that we can make things power and move
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_006 the electricity travels through the wire because it flows through the wire and it gets the energy from the battery because the energy they have stored in the battery comes out of the wires and it connects to it has to connect to the casing and the base of the light bulb so that the light bulb will light
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_030 i think that the energy would go just go no where and they would stop in a light bulb would not light
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_031 i noticed that first the bulb that not light and when we clicked in the with the wire moves and it the light bulb did
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_024 the direction of flows goes different ways one way it goes corner clockwise and the other way it goes clockwise and the energy always comes out of the negative side of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_014 some way it means that it is getting energy from the battery and its traveling to the light from a wire because of electricity wire
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_011 light bulbs hm get their energy from the wire and the wire gets it electricity from the battery so that the electricity from the battery travels through the wire and the wire give that energy to the light bulb to makes it light
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_015 i see electricity traveling from battery to the light bulb and the light bulb is producing light and then energy is coming out of the base of it or no there is energy from the negative that is touching the casing wire and there is energy from the positive that is touching the base the base of the light bulb
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_010 in a circuit wires carry energy
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_021 the blue dots represents energy that is flowing through the wires
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_025 the direction of flow to enter the other way
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_018 the negative energy is coming out of the negative side of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_022 electricity flows into the positive side of the battery
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_016 the flow is flowing from counter clockwise and its energy coming out of the and the battery the d cell battery into the wires
myst_008045_2014-04-03_11-11-19_EE_1.1_017 electricity flows by the battery the d cell battery is giving of energy into the wires and the wires are transferring the energy over it to the light bulb and the light bulb is producing the light
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_009 you have to fill it to the brim
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_034 ere a beaker a graduated cylinder and a syringe they all measure volu
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_039 the tools or the units i
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_013 i do not exactly understand what you are saying i am so sorry but i do not
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_006 i do not understand what you are saying exactly i am sorry
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_036 measure mass the campacity of things and the volume
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_010 we had to figure out if we were being cheated like the soda can did not hold as much as it a actually said it held well if we we
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_012 you could take a syringe and pour one water two water le and so on and so on until you get
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_027 it does not hold as much as well that is how much it could possibly hol it is not but in real life it is probably not holding as much as that
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_030 well l i can not really put this into words i do not know how to put this into words sorry
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_033 campacity is higher than the volume
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_025 it is not putting as much as it could
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_026 volume is how much could it there is and ha campacity is how much it can possibly hol
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_008 you could fill it to the brim
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_007 they have two different capaciti
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_029 tha i can not really answer that with my level of knowledge not saying that i am done but
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_046 could follow it on a beaker
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_023 it is as much as the can can possibly hold
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_045 you could squirt it into a beater beaker not a beater
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_042 you could just use the syringe and suck it out or you could pour it out
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_017 it is not full to the very top
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_032 volume is what is there and the campacity is what it can possibly hold that is what i see in the picture
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_047 to measure
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_041 you could use syringes and just measure that that is probably the easi
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_049 you could figure out how i forget what i was going to say
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_018 it is not f the total campacity that it could hold is three hundred and thirty-three but it holds three hundred milliliters
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_048 because sometimes the syringe will not exactly tell you what you have
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_038 there was not enough water to make another fifty
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_043 it sucks up water and then it spits it out when you push pull sucks in push s
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_019 milliliters are a type of zero i forgot what i was going to say i am so sor
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_020 it opens a can and shows you what
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_015 you could take a syringe and do it i guess
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_037 the syringes are filling up they each have five hundred but there is not enough water there is only enough for forty-two so it has a one hundred and forty
myst_997702_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_004 it is about how much s something can possibly hold
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_028 the intestines uhm absorb the water and nutrients
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_010 well technically what is up is the hair but anyway the brain cells are micro they are smaller and they make up memory
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_013 skin cells can dry and die
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_009 that they are muscle and they are cells
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_015 have 1000000s and 1000000000s and 1000000000000s of cells and yeast only has one
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_012 i see regular cells
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_007 the human cells have are different because they are they are not do not are not similar
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_001 good how are you
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_018 i do not remember
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_011 it shows me the brain cells
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_019 it is the digestive system for humans and for butterflies
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_014 skin bone blood organs
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_003 it is yeast it is yeast
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_027 the stomach stores food and it also breaks down food well it does not store food but it breaks down food for further digestive it breaks down the food for further
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_016 well i do not know but i think have humans have more cells but if you are talking about yeast there is a lot more yeast so but i still think humans have more cells
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_029 sure digestive systems cells those are the main points
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_002 uhm food webs and systems and cleaves
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_024 it mechanically breaks down food into smaller pieces so it can go through your esophagus and go into your stomach which breaks down even further which puts it into your small intestines which absorb it and then put it into your large intestines which absorb the water so you do not get dehydrated and then it compacts the waste and yeah
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_023 uhm it shows the first part of the digestive first part of the digestive system which is the mouth and saliva
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_005 it is different types of cells
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_026 it i do not know what it does in the digestive system all i know is it pushes food down into your stomach which is for the digestive system and the rest yeah
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_022 uhm it basically digests stuff and puts it into your body and puts the nutrients into your cells and yeah
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_025 i already told you it brings the food down to the stomach
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_017 this i do not know what it has to do with what we are talking about
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_004 that yeast is alive and everything that has a cell or cells is alive
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_006 i see cells of a leaf and it looks cool
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-10-31_LS_2.3_021 it is showing us the digestive system
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_025 to eat meat and to eat plants
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_023 uhm i do not really know
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_012 it decomposes dead organisms if a tree dies it can decompose the leaves or if a plant dies it will decompose or get rid of whatever it is
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_031 bacteria kill bacteria is a decomposer it can it eats dead organisms but it can also be harmful
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_013 decomposing other organisms other dead organisms
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_037 a red worm is a decomposer yeah
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_008 the grass and the pine cone
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_016 a producer is missing
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_024 only to eat plants not other not well only eat plants not uhm other uhm not to eat other animals
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_005 there is consumers which eat other organisms there are producers which basically produce their own food and there are decomposers which decompose dead organisms
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_004 they are all part of a food web
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_010 from eating other organisms
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_018 the missing organism is fungi
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_038 they basically clean up
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_015 bacteria and fungi are decomposers
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_034 the fox is a uhm the fox is a omnivore
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_029 to eat only dead organisms
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_022 uhm i do not know
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_020 a producer like a like grass or a tree or not a tree but uhm grass or weeds
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_030 they only eat dead organisms and yeah
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_007 they do not have to eat any other organisms they makes sugar from the sun water and oxygen
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_036 this is a decomposer
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_009 it means to eat foods not to produce your own foods like eat consumers or eat producers
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_026 carnivores only eat meat
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_019 a producer is missing here
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_033 a moose is a herbivore
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_006 i makes its own food from the sun
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_027 omnivores eat meat and plants
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_011 the rabbit the lizard the beetle the blue jay the eagle and the snake
myst_022212_2015-01-15_10-44-46_LS_1.3_028 a bear is a omnivore
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_011 it is a subsystem in the universe and it can be a system of its own i guess
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_014 there are three there is the atmosphere hydrosphere and the i forgot the last one
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_004 because they have a lot of interacting parts
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_015 i think the biosphere is about all the things that are on earth like the living organisms the i guess that well yeah that
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_006 it has a subsystem and a lot of interacting parts
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_019 what eats what i guess
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_007 they are subsystems
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_009 because it has a lot of interacting parts and there are a few subsystems in there
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_013 i see a i guess a underwater subsystem a suburban subsystem and a mountain terrain subsystem
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_005 it has a lot of interacting parts
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_002 learning about systems
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_012 i do not know
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_020 well the everything goes to the bacteria and fungus when it dies
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_018 i think this is a food web a food web
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_003 they are all a system
myst_022212_2014-11-14_11-23-40_LS_1.1_008 all of the interacting parts
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_004 the yeast is an organism and the yeast is kind of a decomposer and it breaks down the cookie
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_023 there is no air so it would die
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_016 plants do not need fertilizer but it helps the plants
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_013 this is air plants do need air to survive
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_010 the roots of the plant and watering the plant
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_011 water sunlight and soil
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_015 nutrients plants do need nutrients to survive
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_012 does need water but it needs it also needs oxygen it needs sunlight and it needs nutrients
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_008 we were growing wheat
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_030 they are are the start of the food web if there was not producers then the food web would not work
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_014 sunlight and needs sunlight to survive
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_021 uhm it shows what would happen if one of the materials would get rid of
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_029 it is the start of a food web food web and if there was not photosynthesis then the food web would not happen and there would be no living things basically
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_007 the yeast is a single celled organism i think and maybe each one of those are one yeast
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_024 killed it almost killed it
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_026 they both kill the plants
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_005 the yeast needs the water to break down the cookie for
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_003 it is water and it grows
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_002 uhm i have been studying about decomposers and yeah decomposers and omnivores and stuff
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_017 house that is about it
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_006 they are decomposers and they are used on bread
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_027 has all three nutrients which makes it awesome and yeah
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_025 no water it is not as bad as no air but still almost killed it
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_020 by uhm photosynthesis it is basically the cell that when it hit s the plants it can turn into sugar
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_009 it has sunlight the other does not have sunlight
myst_022212_2015-01-15_11-01-17_LS_2.1_028 because it has all three nutrients
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_003 they all have veins
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_008 the edges look like a chainsaw and the veins make it look like a feather so maybe it is a feather chainsaw
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_012 showing labels of uhm it is showing coming up blue coming up and coming down so it is showing a leaf it not showing the roots coming up to the leaf
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_005 it is a parallel leaf
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_013 i do not know
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_001 i am doing great how are you doing today
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_004 uhm all of the leafs all the leafs uhm all the leafs uhm all the leafs are named for all the leaves are named from how they look
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_006 it is a hand leaf so stop bugging me just kidding me it is a hand palmate leaf
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_011 uhm i do not know uhm it looks like a circulatory system
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_002 it is a leaf and veins
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-23-54_LS_3.1_010 it is the circulatory system
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_032 you need it in your blood for nutrient
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_023 parts of the respiratory system
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_016 they carry blood they carry blood
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_020 blood to the cell carry blood to the cells
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_030 they are tubes that carry air and branch off the trachea and go deep into the lungs
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_028 i already told you but it exchange gases to the blood to bring to the cells for nutrients also you have to breathe to stay alive
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_029 i do not uhm it is it is the main organ in the respiratory system
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_017 a is the uhm a is the blood vessels b is the heart and c is the blood
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_003 it is the circulatory system
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_008 it is blood and the blue part are the cells and the blue things that are moving are carbon dioxide
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_013 it pumps blood
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_022 it is the respiratory system
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_004 uhm can you repeat that
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_021 okay the circulatory system we gone through the heart and uhm blood vessels and veins
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_005 it has a circulatory system it goes out through the artery and it comes back in through the veins and the heart pumps the blood
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_018 it is the heart it pumps blood
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_006 wait uhm uhm oxygen coming into the blood and carbon dioxide and nitrogen and stuff is coming out
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_024 it is breathing to get oxygen to the blood to carry the cells
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_014 i am blood coming in and out and it being gross kind of
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_001 uhm i am doing okay uhm how are you doing
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_034 from mouth and the nose
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_026 it takes oxygen to the blood to
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_011 uhm i do not know the heart the veins and the arteries
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_019 c carries the blood to the cells
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_009 i do not know
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_031 uhm i do not know
myst_022212_2015-01-22_11-27-28_LS_3.4_002 seriously do not know what i have been studying in science
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_004 circulatory system for the win i told you
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_012 it gives oxygen to the blood stream and it takes off c two
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_001 i am not very good how are you doing
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_011 uhm they are important
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_006 it is it at work also after i finish you have to say hi before you say your answer or before you ask another question
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_013 it is important for your blood
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_005 human respiratory system is uhm air system for the wind
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_002 just kidding i am doing good uhm i do not know what i have been learning but i am actually doing pretty good so yeah just kidding
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_015 from a and b no it was e not f
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_009 uhm it uhm it involves different parts it involves the trachea the mouth the nose the bronchi and bronchioles and the lungs also it involves the diaphragm
myst_022212_2015-01-16_11-31-55_LS_3.3_007 you need it to live
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_004 olume is how much it is something is capacity are the same thing campacity is the volume of a liquid
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_005 i would probably do one part at a time
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_032 it is p pushing the water inside throughout the front
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_010 you get different answers because some are cause the group one is bigger and group two is small
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_009 well i think that it could probably hold a lot of water it because there is no water in the empty cu and it is easier to get water in something when there is nothing in it
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_034 you would fill it up with water and read how many it was
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_008 might tell you that you have this much water cause we are cooking this it is a kind of important kind of measurement
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_019 the little spin is one millimeter and so the thing is one hundred millimeters
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_024 i have used them in cooking
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_014 we are measuring how much water is in the cup
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_033 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_027 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_018 can be broken down by 100s it can be broken down by ones can be broken down by 500s 200s 300s 400s and 200s almost any way
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_007 it mainly tells you that you can you have this much left in the cup
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_003 well well i took an empty cup and we are done with scales so we started water today and yesterday we started water but we used scales but today we really like started measurement for water and it was pretty fun
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_012 it is a picture of a liter
myst_998654_2010-28-09_00-00-00_MS_3.1_013 well we can measure different waters amounts of waters ow
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_007 a thermometer because thermometers can tell you a diff the different temperatures
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_015 the letter c stands for celsius so you are measuring in celsius cal degrees fahrenheit would probably mean more like forty or fifty degrees instead of twenty but celsius is a cooler thing to measure with than fahrenheit and makes more sense for freezing and boiling celsius makes a lot more sense than fahrenheit that way
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_024 the third and first cups are hotter than the second and the first cups
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_029 it is fifty degree celsius so it is warmer than the water on the left which is ten degrees celsius
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_006 it means that b could be cold and a could be hot and c could be in between them
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_013 so that we are all using the same thing and we are not like no c was warmer no a was warmer no c no a no c no a and fighting about it cause it is a really silly thing to fight about if a one cup is warmer the other cup because they could be the exact same temperature like in this picture or they could be totally different temperatures
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_021 you look at the little red line so the first cup was twenty degrees the second cup was five degrees these are all in celsius one hundred degrees was cups this cup three is one hundred degrees cup four is cu fifty-five degrees they are all celsius
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_030 tells you that the water is warmer than the temperature of the little water
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_002 well we have been learning about the metric system in science so we are like i am not really sure how to explain it but we have been doing lot of stuff that our teacher kim made that we helped bring stuff in for it and stuff
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_020 if it is the halfway point is fifty for celsius so if it is below fifty it is cold and if it is above fifty it is hot is kind of the way i think of it
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008 it looks like cup a is twenty degrees cup b is five degrees and cup c is twenty degrees just like cup a so cup a and c are the same degrees or temperatu
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_009 well they are using as a thermometer and a thermometer can tell the temperature of a room or a d place or a thing anything basically
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_028 the water on the left is hotter
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_026 it is hotter than the
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_019 ause degree celsius makes more and a lot of different countries only like two or three countries probably use degrees fahrenheit as their temperature measurement and the usa is probably is one of those countries
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_027 we took the ice water and
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012 different humans feel different stuff so the human body is not a good thing to rely on for temperature but if we use a thermometer each thermometer will give the exact same measurement for it so it works better than using your finger
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_014 it measures something and the thing that a thermometer measures is temperature celsius degrees or fahrenheit degrees
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004 you could sense that it was cold
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_022 the ones on the right are w us probably colder the ones on the left are hotter because one hundred is boiling so the third cup is as hot as it can get t
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016 we used the unit of temperature or measurement because the unit helps us to understand the temperature of something or the room some people is jobs are to me just measure temperature like the g weather guy on television or tv as some people like to call it but tv rots your brain
myst_998654_2010-04-10_00-00-00_MS_4.1_011 we put our fingers in water to see if we could estimate the correct temperature and we put them in order of what we thought was the coolest the warmest and the second and the one in the middle and a lot a people got a c b and a lot of people got c b c a b nobody got b in the middle or first b was always last because b was really cold
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_020 look on the back and see what the volume says
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_023 each one is fifty millimeters
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_019 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_033 that the shape and the volume are not always the same the volume and it do not matter but the size of the container does
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_024 the volume of what is in the cup
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_022 how much there was from the bottom of b
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_025 you should measure all the way to the top
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_009 they tell you to they tell you how much it is and do you call this a conversation
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012 each line represented two it did not have the darker lines that they
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_031 they are different sizes but they are the same otherwise
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_032 it takes two hundred millimeters of water to it do it
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_034 it does not matter
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_028 two hundred millimeters of water are filled with vessels
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_027 it is at the top
myst_998654_2010-30-09_00-00-00_MS_3.2_011 i think that this is all a joke
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008 we measured the mass and estimated then we saw what it really was and with a scale twice
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_033 it is in a perfectly straight line
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_021 group two has a bigger paper clip and group one has a smaller paper clip
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010 use a scale to figure out the weight
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_004 i think the mass
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_003 well our group decided that the wood weighed the least but when we predicted we thought the wood weighed the least and the checker the second least and the disk the most but then when we measured it out we the wood was actually the second heaviest and the not the plastic disk was the least heaviest and the disk was still the heavi
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_019 the balance gives you a more accreate accurate estimate or an answer and because instead of your hands cause you move your hands the way you want to move your hands but you can not move the balance the way the way you want to move the palance without putting something else inside the balan
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_017 it is a paper clip
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_002 we just started learning about mass today in misses strine is class
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_025 that is one gram we used those for measuring how much stuff weighed
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_022 you could have them what you could do is you could have them use the same size instead of different size
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_006 well i well mass is like how much something weighs and the size and stuff so it depends on the measurement you get
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_029 the large paper clip equals one gram
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_028 i know that it weighs more than the small one because of the size and mass
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_034 well i am not really sure what i can say about it
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_032 well the weight of the metal disk is determined by how many grams there are in the
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_026 we measured the things we used in science
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_015 well it the scale has paper clips and the plastic disk in it with the two cups and we dropped paper clips in until it measured out correctly with the plastic disk and the other two things
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_009 well i kinda think that we could use our hands to measure them and sometimes we and we but in class today we mainly used scales
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_020 i discovered that the paper clips that we used were different sizes and that is why the people got different answers that were a lot different so the people who had small paper clips there has got they got bigger estimates the people with big paper clips got smaller estimates
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_035 means that the object weighs eight grams because the scale has a straight line an on it it means that is how much your object weighs so that means this metal thing weighs eight
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_013 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_030 we figured out that we had the small paper clips not the big ones cause other people were getting like eighteen or eight or nine paper clips for the metal disk and we are like huh we were in the 30s that
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_014 well you could use different references to measure them
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_007 well it might affect because the wood stuff because plastic is heav lighter than metal because metal is harder and stronger and heavier than it and plastic is is not as strong and heavy as metal is and the same with wood
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_011 well the metal ball well the metal disk weighs more than the plastic disk so probably the metal disk is going to be the one that weighs more than the wood if it weighs more than the plastic disk
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_023 group two has smaller results group one has bigger results
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_005 means that they have more mass
myst_998654_2010-23-09_00-00-00_MS_2.1_018 it if you use the balance and put it on top of other thing underneath it helps you measure because it becomes a measuring scale for you to use and you can use your hands like that
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_020 measuring it with your pinkie or with your hand or feet or part of your body by measuring it that way
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_032 zero you know how long something is
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_035 at a horse ranch you probably would not be carrying measuring tape around but if you wanted to know how long your horse was you would probably need to estimate
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_017 that does not make sense
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_014 there is one inch in the unit we are looking at right now
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_021 well it is kind of like you have your hand and your pinkie out and then i used both my hands so i could get the best measurement i could get and so you used your hand and your pinkie to measure as far as you could get
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_028 well if you measure something a ton of times you are probably one of the times going to get the right estimate so it helps you
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_016 your pinkie or your hand or your foot
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_008 the door knob
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_012 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_010 the metric system
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_003 so we esti mated and we me and my pinkie is about the size of that
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_031 ba by ge by practicing and practicing again and again you can get a lot better at something because if you practice it makes you get a little better every time so then once you have done it a lot you get the right estimate most of the ti
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_009 they are all scientific measurement uses
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_011 it is about measuring different sizes of things and it is a scientific way in length and width
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_005 because that shows you s because the it show you numbers and it is easier so you know
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_022 well the first one is hand is ten inches long so if you were measuring something really long like a person you could use your hand to measure up their body until the top of their head and you would learn know how long their they were or you were measuring with width then you would be able to see how long it was
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_033 cause you might not have a measuring stick tape or stick with you so then you would have to estimate the size of something with a number of people like if you had a party you would have to estimate the number of people if not everybody said no or not everybody said yes
myst_998654_2010-14-09_00-00-00_MS_1.2_030 etting better at estimating because it helps you get better and get the closer estimate
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_035 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_002 we i do not really know how to explain it but we have been not really sure h
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_009 you can use your h you can hold it and give a good guess to what you would think or if you had done it before then you would be able to say zero i have done this before i can i can say okay it has this many pencils that is two more pencils than what i had so it is probably two or three more gram
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_028 to weigh something heavy
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_032 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_026 a kilogram is ten of one hundred grams
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_033 yo you need to use a scale
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_007 they are being used to measure the mass of the piece of wood
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018 it is going to to be a lot more than what you have on the sides so you are going to need a lot more
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020 the orange weighs more than all the gram pieces in the cup
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_027 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_015 a metal disk weighs eight grams
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_016 the toy car weighs seventy grams
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_025 it is one hundred grams and on the other side it is one hundred grams too
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_019 it would be very hard
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_012 an say alright the pencil is two nickels that must mean it is ten grams
myst_998654_2010-24-09_00-00-00_MS_2.2_010 i am not sure what you mean
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_038 need other t to measure capacity syringe is not always the best tool cause it could suck up the bottom of the cup
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_030 you just read how much
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_032 how much water there was in all the syringes put together
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_014 it said three hundred millimeters because that is how they claim is how much there is in it but it looks like this person got thirty-three millime three hundred and thirty-three millyimeters instead how can that work pardon me
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_028 measure things oil water for cooking
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_022 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_009 we took soda cans to see if the soda company told the truth about it or did not not tell the truth about it
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_021 well the capacity has
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_011 we used we left a little space inside and filled it up with water and figured out how much water that was
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_037 figure out the total
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_026 they can be different they are different because capacity is the liquid and the amount that fits in volume is the space that the liquid belongs in capacity is basically the volume of the drink
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_005 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_013 that there is only a little bit inside be there is a lot inside but there is a little bit that is empty at the top so you can shake the soda can
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_027 syringe is on the far left in the middle there is a graduated cylinder and on the side is one liter
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_006 how m much water there is in the cup
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_025 well the capacity
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_018 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_015 means that there is three hundred of the milliliters
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_008 we have we had to use a syringe and measure the amount of water in a graduated cylinder too
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_007 you could look at how m the line and use a syringe and say okay a is fifty millimeters for an example so b is going to be one hundred cause it is the same difference
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_039 you looked at how much there was total
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_019 three hundred millimeters is measuring how much soda there is inside of orange soda right now
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_020 stands for three hundred and millimeters that is inside the soda can
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_017 it could ac it will actually her hold more than it says because the
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_023 the capacity was re
myst_998654_2010-01-10_00-00-00_MS_3.3_035 you would measure how much water there was
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_025 you need to use the same size
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_013 it is mainly about figuring out how long something is so you know how long it is or what you need to get to do it or like how much you need for cooking
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_014 you need to know how long something is and it is mainly about how long it is
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_029 et almost everybody in the entire world
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_021 it was seven straws for group a
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_012 to measure things and also some kinda stick there little longer than yard sticks
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_027 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_022 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_019 i think that they are different sizes sometimes
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017 so we put one straw in front of another straw all the way down this table to figure out how long that table was
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_009 what we most recently is we have been working on money
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_020 we had different lengths of straws to see what the differ so it could look like i think
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_024 they are the same for the standard measurements
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_023 it means if it is this different sizes it can become dif it can be you can think it it is kind of like a different sized table but it is the exact same size
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_026 it means kilometers
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_015 it was mainly about how long something was in length or width so you knew how long it was
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_001 hi my name is
myst_998654_2010-13-09_00-00-00_MS_1.1_004 i got it to work
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_030 you probably use the reference for the pinkie as two instead of one
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_035 i guess i think it kind of looks like something i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_019 big the object was because if it was something re
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_032 well each line is exactly the same and on this meter tape it looks like it gets to ten it changes the co its color then twenty it changes then 30s forty trillion, five hundred and six billion, seventy million, eight hundred and nine thousand, one hundred and it changes each time the at which i think kind of probably helps the person using the tape to tell how many 10s there is
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_016 irst of all may need help from other people to make exact measurements and now that we have all these computer and stuff we c sometimes you can pay to solve that kind of thing
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_022 it gives us a reference to do stuff because renfreces are important and helpful
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_018 a meter tape because you can not really cause you would probably break the meter stick or and it would be hard to move
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_015 well when i measured my friend she it was a little hard because we thought that the stand and our bodies would be a lot different and then we figured out that it was the same
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_005 i do not really get what that means
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_020 the finger is the same size as one kilometer
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_011 we needed to use the correct techniques that niques that the teacher recommended
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_017 well we used a measuring s stick that had a ton of one hundred kilometers on it i forgot what it is called a measuring tape like that and we used a lot of different tools because like a stick would not be right to measure a nose but it would be right to measure an arm span
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_023 because it is a centimeter long so it helps you say okay it is a centimeter long if apple was five pinkies it would be five centimeters long
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_033 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_024 we measured our ankles our whole body around our neck and stuff like that and from our n hip to our knee and our knee to the ground
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_002 use a measuring tape or a c use your hand or a referen
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_007 it shows you that if you begin at one end end and end at the other
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_028 they are the same size
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_013 it is kind of like using a measuring stick to make sure the it is the exact correct height but you need to at least have the measuring stick in the se m place cause if it moves around or you hold it taught the measuring saint tape could rip
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_010 was important that we figured out the closest guess we could get to with our friend
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_003 it helps you figure out how long something is
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_031 you use the smallest you know i am not sure what it is called
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_009 it felt kind of hard because nobody had the exact right way to measure somebody is height
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_025 there were not really any body part measurements that were the same cause we did not get to finish measuring before we left for thus
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_034 i think the meter is the smallest just if the second centimeter then millimeter and that is the the ge smallest from the left to the on the right side that is the biggest of the smallest
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_004 because meter tapes are the same size and hands are different sizes
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_006 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_012 t is important because then you can if the answer is the same answer twice then it is probably the exact correct answer
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_036 you would use them when you were using a meter stick or when you needed to measure something
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_014 it was a little hard because sometimes you thought it would be the same results but it came out a lot differently
myst_998654_2010-21-09_00-00-00_MS_1.3_027 the foot is the same size as the forearm
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_006 it is a wet sponge which means it has not gone all the way to soak a soaked sponge but it is still getting big it is still bigger than
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009 when it is all the way when it is the largest it can get
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005 well it is a sponge that is smaller than the other two because it is not wet
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_028 we were trying to figure out the difference
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_026 so you measured them both out and the answer is thirteen grams of water cause you took three away
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_029 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_015 you put them in one cup and the you put the in the other cup you put a th the thing you are weighing which wi is a sponge and then when you put the grams in the other cup to weigh it
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_027 it can hold thirteen grams of water
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_019 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_013 you use grams to weigh it
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004 sponge on the left is dry the sponge in the middle is wet and the sponge on the right is soaked and they grew as they got wet and drew dry
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_016 i am not sure what that means
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_011 you can take the wet sponge you can use a sponge and use grams to weigh it
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_010 well me and my partner worked together and we both weighed sponges wet and dry and did a lot of really fun work with it
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008 well a wet sponge is kind of a sponge that is not soaked yet but it is in the water
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_030 you could use it for y measure for using how much the weight is of something
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_002 well we have been worki today we worked with a sponge and water
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_032 it is one gram
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_018 well i kind of noticed that it means okay this could be twenty times more or fifteen or two or it could be a diff but it is going to be a different weight when it is wet
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_007 it means that it is totally wet and it is you it is dripping really wet
myst_998654_2010-27-09_00-00-00_MS_2.3_014 i am not sure
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005 they happened at the in the first hi
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_028 you could use a thermom
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_007 it gets it stays the same and then get would get warme
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012 they can freeze
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_038 bye bye bye bye mar
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_018 r about showing your wor
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_032 starting the first number and s ending at the last number
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_025 it is mainly about temperature being recorded at different times because if you record temperature at different times it is going to give you different results so temperature is never the same and that is why we have the weather guy on tv to talk about it
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_002 and the kilom and c in celsius great
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023 i put the temperature and the minutes of how long it had been
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027 what did you say
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016 i displayed it wi on a line
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_006 rned a lot and they got really cold and we put were not allowed to put our hands in which was sad cause we were hot
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_003 well i discovered that it got colder and colonel
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_009 well it started really high and then it got colder and colder an
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_033 she started at five ended at twenty it is fifteen
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013 well it is getting colder and colder and colder
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_021 well it helps you
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024 the dots are where the temperature was and then the dots show it moving down and up and down and up and whatever
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_035 the first two are below fifty and the second two are over fift
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014 it takes up more space and starts to burn
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_010 the little red line that looks like blood goes down
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_037 that the first two are lower than fifty and the second two are h
myst_998654_2010-05-10_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004 i observed that when it changed the first time it changed like almost ten down or twenty or thirty or whatever down

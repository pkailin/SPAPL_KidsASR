myst_018212_2014-10-10_08-58-48_LS_1.3_016_comb they can not be the same because the herbivores eat grass and the carnivores eat meat so they could not be the same cause they would not eat the grass and the other animals would not eat the meat the omnivores would eat the berries and meat so they could be like the herbivores and carnivores detrivores eat things like they are decomposers they eat the dead animals so they are alike to everything
myst_018212_2014-10-10_08-58-48_LS_1.3_027_comb decomposers would eat the dead soil and the soil inside of a dead plant mushrooms would also do that but they would grow on top of it and start using it for fuel worms would attack it sort of like a carnivore they they consume the food from the other animals or organisms to eat to get food for their own cells

myst_997281_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_006_comb well we we sort of had wires and we put the wires on the battery ends from the positive to the negative no negative to the and so then we hooked that up to the motor and then we hooked one of the motor is wires to the switch that we had yeah it is spinning the the the opposite direction that it was when the battery was the opposite way
myst_997281_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_038_comb well since it is if you flip the battery around like you told me to do it will go the opposite direction that it does when it is the from negative to positive i do not really know i do not think my teacher has told us but yeah because it is still flowing the same speed but it is just the opposite direction i do not really know
myst_997281_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_022_comb i think it will not work as a g i d i just do not think it will work i do not really remember doing it i think that it is going from the negative to the positive because it is just like switching the way the electricity flows just like you switched the battery and the motor
myst_997281_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_020_comb well the battery has two wires connected to it and then it is connected to the motor which makes the little tape flap spin well maybe because it switches the battery it switches the motor is way of running it is like the same thing from negative to positive to positive to negative no i am not really sure instead of going from left to right it will go from right to left
myst_997281_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_012_comb well there is two wires connected to the battery and to the light bulb and the energy the battery has gives it to the light bulb and it makes it light up i can see that it is going from the left to the right s and it goes through the light bulb like if it was still sort of yeah well i do not think it matters if it is from the positive to negative as far as the energy goes
myst_997281_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_028_comb it looks like it is still working but it does not look as fast to me what do you exactly mean like i said it just switches the way the the motor is flap runs i do not think much happens because it just sort of since you switched the battery it is sort of like switching the motors way of the tape spinning
myst_997281_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_030_comb yeah that would be cool well as i told you before the wires are connected to the motor and the electricity from the battery goes through the motor and makes the flap spi
myst_997281_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004_comb well today we did science and we used a board and we placed a light bulb in a light bulb holder and a battery holder in a ba and the battery in a battery holder and we made a circuit so the and we also had a motor s and we had to make the motor and the light the light had to go on and the motor had to little piece of tape that had to spin i do not think it does
myst_997281_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011_comb well using the washers we had to make the weight strong enough to make the magnets not want to be t well we have to put it together and we did it with a chip in the middle and it we had to see how many washers it took so that it would take the magnets apart
myst_997281_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005_comb well we have some what are they called washers we have two cups and we have two magnets and we use them to see how the force is how it works well we just had to use them as like a weight to lift the magnets apart
myst_997281_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_015_comb why do you want to do it like wh that when you switch the batteries they you can see the difference that it was dimmer before but then it lights up brightly when i switched the batteries i noticed that they became more brightly well the battery gives energy to the through the wires to the light bulb which makes it light up
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015_comb well here you can trace two pathways with one light bulb and another light bulb you can trace another one well there is the two light bulbs and a one battery so i am guessing cause we did this in class it is probably not going to light very brightly it is probably going to be pretty dim
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_024_comb well the battery has a wire to they little thing that connects to the light bulb which makes that light up but then you need the wire to the oth the other side of the battery which has another wire that goes to the light bulb and then that has another wire that goes to the bulb battery i think it is a parallel circuit well it is like a circuit that it is where you can trace two pathways
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_025_comb well the two circuits is that you can like trace two pathways like you can in this one because can trace one from the battery to one light bulb and the battery to an another light bulb well i think they s they lit up bright more brightly i think the other one would burn out as well cause it is not a parallel circuit with all the circuits and everything and it the other light bulb will still keep working because it is parallel
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_060_comb well yeah when we were doing the experiment of when the people bo bought the string of lights we had done it and then we put like a little piece of paper under it to see if it would block the electricity flow and it did and as soon as that happened the other one burned out as well i think it looked a little like this this is a parallel circuit
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_018_comb well one is from the battery to the first light bulb and then one you could trace i am not sure if it is but from one light bulb to another that looks like another one to me yeah it can not go through paper what do you mean by if we made it parallel would that make it shine bright more brightly
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_047_comb well a circuit the word circuit comes from circle so you cou would be usually be able to trace with your finger a circle or not
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_027_comb just because we did this experiment where they they told us in the science book that people were buying these big rows of lights and they were using them and when one burnt out the r the rest burnt out and so we had to try to combine two groups ideas and our group is worked
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_031_comb well i think this would work because it has two batteries touching but i think the problem is that it is not i think the minus side should be where the plus side is
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_038_comb well like i said we did this one in class and many times and it does not really work very well so i would add another battery and that would make it to i mean it it would make them brighter well this is a what is it called a chocolate chip mint
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_064_comb well i see a battery and a motor and i do not know what the m is i think it might be a light bulb or something but i it looks like to me a parallel circuit there is a little thing that says enable hardware acceleration i do not know i think it probably would but the good thing about parallel circuits is that when one burns out the rest do not
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_046_comb well i can see two circuits but they are separate and one had i think is a parallel circuit and one is series well it is if you have a cir a series circuit you can only trace one with your finger which is usually a cir a circle which is why circuit comes from circle well we were talking about parallel cir circuits and series circuits
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_066_comb because you can trace a pathway from one motor to the other do you mean with the two light bulbs this is also a parallel because you can trace two pathways again
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_050_comb what i see is two circuits and one the one on the left has a battery then two light bulbs and the one on the right has a battery and then it has a light bulb and then it has an another light bulb but it is sort of more like a it i think that one is parallel and the one on the left is a series circuit
myst_997281_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.2_061_comb well since p electricity cannot go through paper it would stop the light bulb is brightness to come out i do not really know you could do it like with a light bulb and then you could get a wire to it and then the wire to the light bulb which gets an one wire to the battery we have been working on parallel circuits and one other circuit which i can not remember the name of
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_022_comb this one is it is it is only one pathway because there is four wires but there is only one pathway to flow from here to the other one well the wire is kind of like a pathway or a highway for the energy to go through and if the wire was not there the energy would not go through well a parallel circuits is a certain type of circuit that you can use to light up light bulbs and stuff
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_008_comb i think it is something like that cause if you took out say the left light bulb then the the right one would go out and would not turn back on until you put on the left one
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_018_comb i think it tells me that the middle thing is the light the battery in the middle the things that are surrounding it are the wires and the two little round things with the little lines in it are the light bulb
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_009_comb well on the other one the there is two pathways for the batteries i mean for the light the energy to flow through but with this one it is the only one pathway so if there is not a source to get through to go to the other side then it can not go through this one has one and the other one has two
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_017_comb yes and no the wires look the same the battery looks a little different and the light bulbs look different this one i think is the one where if you turn off a light bulb all the other ones are going to turn off because there is not two other wires touching the battery there is two others touching the light bulbs and on two touching the battery
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_012_comb i think that this one is the same as the other one but there is more than one wire but what i mean by more than one wire is there is more than one wire touching the battery when one bulb goes out on this one the other one stays on because there is still a pathway for the energy to h flow through
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_030_comb i see that one light bulb pair of light bulbs is brighter than the other one and that there are two different circuits i believe there is more that one type of circuit i think there is about two circuits cause one type is when you take off one light bulb then the other one goes out and the other is when you can take out a light bulb and the other one still goes on
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_015_comb this is the one that i was talking about where there is two pathways going no wait yeah so i think this is the other one where there is two pathways and then if you took out the left light bulb the right one would still be going on
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_014_comb i think if the wire was not there if there was only the little notch at the top that the light bulb would not even work i know that circuits is what i keeps the light bulbs in our house running and it is not the parallel circuit because when we turn off the light in all the other lights do not turn off
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_028_comb in our house it is not parallel because parallel is the one that when you take off when you turn off a light bulb all the other one is turn off and the other one is the one where you turn one off the other one is still saint i think that that is because there is not an as many bends and twists in the wire maybe cause that would be harder for the energy to get through than just a straight or slightly curved wire
myst_997275_2009-12-01_00-00-00_ME_3.3_026_comb i think it could be both actually i think parallel is the one where if you take one off then the other one turns off mabe i am not really sure the circuit i think is pretty much the same as the other one only the light bulbs are by to other and the wires are the same but they are shaped different not that i remember
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_043_comb going it is going from the minus side through the light bulb back down to the plus side and des it flips it around a highway for the electricity to come through to the light bulb we we w i did not work with the blue thing and i did not work with the red thing on the light bulb we only worked with the wire the d cell battery and just a light bulb not with the red stuff on it
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_019_comb well there is the little thing where you put it actually no i was just talking about that area where the notches are well here no because the wire is not touching the other side of the battery but the light bulb is but it seems to be on which is confusing me
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_009_comb well you would have to make sure that it was on the the two parts perfectly otherwise it would not turn on if it is in the right place it should turn on and stay on for a little bit the the electricity is actually flowing through the battery to the light bulb and the electricity is flowing through one of the notches or something back into the battery
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_029_comb it travels from the plus side back through the light bulb to the minus side and gets stored into the minus side it minus side until the battery is burned out at the well you can not put it on the glass but further down from the glass there should be a little swirly thing where it would go in one of the sockets you would put one of the wires on there and then the little round thing on the bottom the wire has to be in the right place
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_007_comb well what you do would you wrap it a kind of make a circle around the battery and then you would put it on the plus side and touch with both the wires you touch eleven metal part and then another metal part and it should turn on
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_035_comb it goes from the plus side through the light bulb til it starts glowing and then when it is glowing more electricity flows then it goes to the minus side builds up until all the electricity is gone from the plus side and either the light bulb and the battery will burn out or just the battery will burn out
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_023_comb you would have to put it on the swirly thing kind of right under the light the glass part and then right under that is the little lip kinda thing and you have to touch one of the wires there too the wires are sort of kind of like if you were driving a car would sort of be like a highway to get up into the light bulb and back down again into the light bulb
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_051_comb they are i believe they are like that is supposed to help it come though and if it was not there it would be v fairly hard to make the electricity come through well it is kind of like a circle of the wire coming from one side of the battery to the other and yes it is a circuit well it seems like it is actually going from the minus side first but that is not what my teacher said
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_049_comb i see it is well i saw it cause it was it will not work if i do not put it on the button but it it we it is going through a certain parts up to a little wire coming up into the glass part making it glow coming back down and going around and then up again
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_073_comb maybe it is coming from the light bulb since it is touching the battery it must be coming through the light bulb back into the battery somehow by the light bulb we were using wire and a light bulb and a battery to see if we could light up the light bulb
myst_997275_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_027_comb well the electricity has to flow in a certain place to go back up to the bulb and go through the kinda thing that looks like a spring where it makes it hard for the electricity to go and then it lights up well i do not think it would work because it is only touching one side of the battery well you could stack up like you could have three piles stacked up one on the left one in the middle and one on the right to make h more passengers and balanced
myst_996431_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_016_comb well the d boat will have the least passengers because it is smaller and then c it will have the biggest because it is the biggest one i noticed that the taller the taller the pennies are stacked up the more it can hold we have been learning about variables
myst_996431_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_015_comb well this picture tells me the more the pennies are like spread out in the boat the heavier it gets and if they are stacked up they are wider i figured out that the bigger the lifeboats the more pennies it could hold you already axed asked me that if you stack up the pennies you can maybe hold more passengers a is the biggest it would a hold more passengers
myst_996431_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_012_comb if you like drop the pennies from a high place or something that will that will make the boat sort of heavy and then it will knock it down to the water so it will sink how big or wide the boat is if the boat is wide more passengers can fit in the corners or on the sides and for the wait i do not know
myst_996431_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_007_comb that is how many passengers it could hold it makes me think about how many pennies like are fitting in each boat we put pennies in little cups so that the pennies are related to the passengers so we see how many the cups can hold i found out that it swings if you make it longer it could go fa this more times too
myst_996431_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_003_comb i do not know the string does most of the work there is a penny connected to a pencil and a paperclip and a string i do not really know that either the string the paperclip the penny and the pencil make the string shorter because it will swing faster i do not know it swings back and forth they will swing back and forth how fast the pennies go back and forth it goes back and forth
myst_996431_2009-02-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_020_comb the shorter it is the faster it will swing side ways zero i notice that the x capacity is the millimeters and the y capa pa capacity thing is the passengers i see that the numbers rising up the x axis is at the bottom of the screen and the y axis is on sort of the side of the screen
myst_996431_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_027_comb when we changed the capacity it was able to hold more pennies maybe the growing of the passengers and the growing of the capacity i see that at the bottom of the screen there are numbers counting by 10s so those are the millimeters and the passengers one hundred millimeters can hold sixty and it just keeps going in a row
myst_996431_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_009_comb i can not remember the y axis is on the side of the screen and we have been make well on every boat the smaller they got the smaller pennies had to go in to the boat i noticed that the number of the capaci the passengers got larger as the capacity grew
myst_996431_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_019_comb the x axis is the where the capacity millimeters are well i think this picture shows the capacity of the boat which is ma well maybe how much it can hold or maybe how long it can stay in the water
myst_996431_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_017_comb i can figure out like the biggest the bigger they are the passengers it is half of the number that the millimeters are i think it is about the y axis is the passengers so like the number below what the millimeters can hold that big of a number from like ninety to sixty or something
myst_996431_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_015_comb well they show the number of something like greatest to or or least to greatest the y axis is how many of p passengers and the x axis is the vol is the capacity how large it is the y axis shows how many passengers there are i can not remember i can not remember i do not remember i do not know
myst_996431_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_016_comb someone is dropping more pennies into the boat if i change a bunch of things it i do not know i can not remember it is telling me a graph about boats i do not know what size the boat is i can not remember and their size so the bigger the boat the more pennies it could hold
myst_996431_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_039_comb i it would like sink that is all i can think of well if there is more pennies on one side a and none on the other side it could tip over and sink actually i mean the that is how many people it can hold pennies are like passengers so like the bigger the boat the more it can hold
myst_996431_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_028_comb i do not know because if all the sides are balanced they will not tip over to the left or the right we did stuff about boats and how many pennies they could hold without sinking make sure everybody is balanced on the boat i do not remember
myst_996431_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_041_comb well if i take less pennies out that can make a difference because it gets lighter so it rises up more out of the water i do not know you put it in between the two little square shaped sticks that are on top of the first stick
myst_996431_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_029_comb well since the top one weighed more it did not get much more hang time because it is so heavy that when it gets in the air it drops down faster it looks like it is put in to the base so so you p so after you put the cork on it you pull back the stick and then let it go
myst_996431_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_026_comb i think the bottom one went f further because the cork was lighter so you know how long so if you pull out five centimeters and you launch it and say it goes forty-nine centimeters that is how far it went actually i really did not understand that question
myst_996431_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_025_comb well if you change the angle if you make it sort of slanted down it might get more hang time in the air and go farther i think it is about seeing how far the cork goes after you launch it they make the cork like fly how far you can launch the cork i think it is all about how far the cork was launched i do not really know yet
myst_996431_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_013_comb you put em in between the two s s two sticks that are on top of the popsicle sticks a base a stick a a stick that could hold an ice pop or something and an ice tray
myst_996431_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_016_comb i noticed that they are using a ruler to measure if you pull it out five centimeters how long it will go with four centimeters it will go i pulled down the stick and i took my finger off and it launched the cork i do not know i did not understand that question we have been working on catapults
myst_996431_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_015_comb well i pulled the i ice cubes ice cubes stick the ice popstick out more and it made it go farther to and it made it go farther because it was longer the weight of the cork makes em different i noticed that the shorter the stick is in the farther it will go
myst_996431_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_021_comb you will not know you will not know your data because if you do not have the winds you do not know like how far your stick was out of the base
myst_996431_2009-07-10_00-00-00_VB_4.2_020_comb it was important because then like you could write your data on a piece of paper so you would know how far it went it is not going the same distance it did at the last starting position i do not remember it swings back and forth it is hanging from a table
myst_996431_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_003_comb s studying the well something i forget i think i changed the length because if may be if it changes the length it could go faster the pendulum is swinging back and forth
myst_996431_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_013_comb we swung it sideways and saw how much how many times you can swing back and forth fifteen in fifteen seconds there is a penny connected to a paperclip and a pencil we changed if it was shorter it would go faster and if it was longer it would go slower i do not remember it makes the penny in the it makes the penny swing back and forth
myst_996431_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_007_comb it is a graph to see how long the s pendulum is i think so you can see your results i forget so when you make an estimate you have something to help you get the answer if it is shorter it goes more swings but if it is longer it goes less swings
myst_996431_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_020_comb if i think if you put another penny and it will still be the same exact amount i think it is about subtracting we have been working on pendulums that is all i can think of the length of the string the length of the string
myst_996431_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_012_comb well i think the labels are the numbers so it goes to two hundred and twenty it tells me that the number of swings is getting sh lower i do not know i do not know
myst_996431_2009-11-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_009_comb it looks like a graph from sh biggest to littlest i do not know zero when it was just the normal water and it did not have any ice in ye yet it was about fifteen degrees and then when we put the ice in it got it dropped down and then it got warmer because the ice started melting and warmer and warmer and warmer
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014_comb the information of how cold or hot the water was what temperature and how and and what time that temperature was
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_025_comb well you would have to write it down it does not just say what the ans say the difference was ten degrees or something you have to figure it out you have to write it down and then subtract and add and do some math after we checked the thermometer every minute
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012_comb then you know that everybody knows that the bottom the they will know what that is they will not say that that that the bottom line is the temperature celsiu degrees celsius and the and time is up and down it is always going to be the same
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_013_comb you could use that zig zaggy graph if it gets warmer you draw the line up higher if it gets colder you draw it lower i noticed that it starts at twenty and ends up at thirteen the third one is one hundred degrees and the hottest i would describe it saint up high and then it goes all pretty far down and then it gets higher and higher and higher
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011_comb the time is at the bottom and how many at the up up and down you could subtract your finish time from your finish temperature from your start temperature and then you could get your answer in this case it would be fifteen degrees
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_026_comb the first one is twenty degrees celsius the second one is five degrees celsius the third is one hundred degrees celsius or boiling and the last one is fifty-five degrees celsius it went down but did not fully go up again once it got colder then it got a little warmer because the els
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_019_comb then it slowly makes it is way back up to the up the graph then it gets warmer in this graph it drops from twenty to five then up to six then up to eight and then up to thirteen again
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_027_comb the first one was pretty normal then the second one was pretty cold the third one was really hot and the last one was pretty hot pretty warm it gets colder if it goes down and then if it goes down it is colder it is dropping the temperature and if it goes up it is increasing the temperature
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023_comb ours it went from twenty all the way to five it went really low graphs are how to keep track of something how to keep track of what you are thinking about
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_008_comb but on a line graph er that graph set it has numbers and days er times and then it gets zig zaggy
myst_996703_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_022_comb you could tell how it goes up and well it starts up high and then it goes down drops down really quickly and then it gets up higher and higher and higher eventually if the red liquid goes down then you know that it is getting colder if it goes up it is getting warm it dropped down from twenty to five in just a minute
myst_996703_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_030_comb that they are one hundred meters i think we were measuring our desk and we had to figure out the perimeter of it we have been measuring i mean no in math we have been doing multiplication and division how big it is
myst_996703_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_010_comb it is when you need if you need to know how to ne if you need to know how long or big something is you measure it and then you can know what how big it is some of them were actually bigger than the other ones so everybody got different answers i am not really sure
myst_996703_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_015_comb i used a yardstick because it is the right size for my desk i think you can do it if they are if they are the right if they are the right size if they are all the same size
myst_996703_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_029_comb you could use a lot of you could use a bunch of rulers or yardsticks and put them all along and then and then look at the highest number and see what it is length is how long something is usually
myst_996703_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_022_comb a meter stick or a yardstick or a ruler they are all the same size you can measure things with rulers yardsticks or meter sticks or sometimes tape measures and other measuring tapes there are one hundred centimeters in a meter and there are ten dec decimeters in a meter also
myst_996703_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_016_comb you can measure things with those and i think they are straws hello my name is max i like to do math and measurement and stuff like that you could put them along in a a row matching them up together in a long row and then you could figure out how long it is
myst_996703_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_021_comb i think people got in big arguments because they could not figure out what to what standards to use and then eventually they finally agreed on some c certain sizes
myst_996703_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017_comb you put it at the edge of your desk and br bring it along and put it down and then you mark where it ended with your finger then you pick it up and put it down on the other side of your finger and keep going if they are all the same size then everyone will get the same answer but if they are different sizes then they are not going to be as long or they might be longer than other ones so they will get different answers
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_016_comb they emptied out the entire orange soda can and there is and there was really three hundred and thirty-three milliliters that time so they must have measured wrong you can measure the campacity of a can
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_029_comb you could use the syringe and suck it up and then s and then get another syringe and suck it up and then add up a the syringes amount and then you would get your answer the number is the volume of the cup
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_021_comb the one on the right i mean le the one on the right is a beaker the one in the middle is a graduated cylinder and the one on the left is a syringe the campacity is thirty-three milliliters more than the volume it is not full to the top
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_030_comb you would add up the the liter the milliliters that you have it is not entirely full the real campacity of the can is three hundred and thirty-three milliliters but how much it has in it since it is not full to the top is three hundred milliliters not three hundred and thirty-three that is probably the campcity of the can
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_005_comb that one is full so that is the real campcity but the one on the right is not full so that is not the full campacity capacity is how much something can hold like a cup or a water ba that tells you that much water is in the graduated cylinder the standard unit is liters and a s the smaller one is milliliters
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_031_comb if you only have one syringe but a bunch of gradutat graduated cylinders you could suck up water in the syringe and then spray it in the one graduated cylinder and keep water in the graduated cylinder and then keep some in the syringe we had to figure out how much cam what the campacity of a soda can was
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_002_comb we have been measuring the campacity of bottles and cans capacity is how much liquid a bottle can hold it is not the real campacity because the real capacity is three hundred and thirty-three milliliters it only has three hundred milliliters in it it is supposed to have thirty-three milliliters more to be full
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_011_comb the three hundred milliliters there means that that can of orange soda has three hundred milliliters of orange soda it is thirty-three it is a thirty-three milliliter difference it is not right
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_018_comb volume is how much is in it like the soda can might only be halfway full because you are not that thirsty or you drank half of it but the capacity is how much it can hold in all it was pretty by
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_017_comb if the orange soda can was full then it is actually three hundred and thirty-three milliliters which means that they that is the campacity and it is the volume
myst_996703_2011-26-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_015_comb volume is how much there is inside of the can like there was three hundred milliliters in the can but the campacity is how much it can fill how much what is the entire how if it is entirely full that is the campacity
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_009_comb you can stick the part one part in the water and then you pull out you pull the little handle thing and it sucks up the water and if you push it back the handle back in then it sprays the water out we measured the campa capacity of a cup it is your it is how it is the full amount of the cup
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_004_comb how much water it could hold or the capacity a tall one could be taller and skinny and then the short one could be short but really really wide so it a shorter one could hold lots and lots more than the than the tall and skinny one you can measure the capacity capacity of something of a cup or a water bottle or something
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_017_comb you could estimate the more you try with a liter or a beaker or something the better at estimating you will get and you can and then you can estimate i do not know it was more short it was shorter and more wide but it was still two hundred milliliters of water
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_018_comb think about the capacity of something you already measured and then you can think of what it is of and look at the size difference and then you can estimate pretty well
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_016_comb you got to fill up a cup of water and then pour it in the graduated cylinder and then you could look you put the graduated cylinder down until the water level is out and then look at what line it is on and then you can know how much it wa how much what the capacity of the cup was
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_021_comb capacity is how much something can hold how much a sponge can hold how much a cup can hold how much a water bottle can hold how much s some how much something something can hold you could pour it in a different cup or a graduated cylinder or something we used the capacity or
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_010_comb the lines tell you how many milliliters it is holding the ones that we used were fifty milli milliliters you could use a and b you know that is fifty so then c and d are the same length apart so that is probably a one hundred about it is a liter we had to measure the capacity of the cup
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_026_comb those are vessels like little containers that are two hundred milliliters in capacity we could use a syringe you should measure all the water in the cup
myst_996703_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_030_comb it does not always matter what shape it is sometimes they are skinny or wide or tall or short it does not matter tall and skinny might be the same capacity as short and wide it is kind of like a beaker you can hold stuff inside of it and you will know how full it is pretty much
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_018_comb okay some people are experimenting that if the first one is going straight and it is going farther but the bottom one is stopping and it is not going that well because the propeller is stopping it is not moving that well and so the first one is going straight and it is going perfect
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_016_comb i think the number of swings is not right because you ha also the string has to be balanced and the propeller has to be moving to fly a plane it has to the string has to be balanced right has to be straight it can not be wiggly cause it is if it is wiggly it is going to stop it and it is not going to go that far
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_021_comb i think what that is all about it makes the propeller spin and if we do not have the rubber band in the bottom it is not going to work i think what flying fast planes is all about you have to see if it is balancing and you have to have it balance because if it is not balanced well when you are trying to balance it it is going to go down and when it goes down it is going to stop so it has to keep the balance up straight it is going very well marty
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_002_comb what we have been doing in science we were we have been doing airplanes we have been seeing is the airplane propeller can fly you have to the propeller is all about making the propeller spin
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_010_comb the different distance could be one could be it has to be balanced and two the propeller has to be good put it in the s in the has to be put in it and also okay so how many spins it takes spins are forty-five spins it made and the distance is how much meter how much meters you measure it
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_017_comb so if the string is s straight up or it a it is not it is going to go down because if you start from the top it is going to go down and if you start from the straight it is going to go really fast but if you go down it is going to stop in the middle so it is not really going to work i think when setting up your my experiment was it was tricky to put it together but it worked really well and
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_026_comb so it has also been nice talking to you marty i think it will because it has to have more power on it and it has to go up farther and i think that would affect it when it spins the thing on the bottom spins around too with it and m and then you measure how much far it went
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_007_comb i think the kinds of things that are important what makes if fly is the propeller makes it fly and that the string is balanced and a and that the straw is great is put good on it
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_023_comb i think was the i think what that is all important about would be changing the propeller and seeing and making it shorter or longer and i am guessing you can use the rubber band instead of using the rubber band you can use s fishing string and you can also make the popsicle stick shorter and to see how how fast it goes
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_006_comb so what the parts of the plane i use the propeller is making it spin and the string the straw and the string is making it balance it yeah it does mean that because this this flight log is not really correct because it says twenty-two spins in two meters and it is not really that far because if it said ten meters then one meter it is not right
myst_996424_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_009_comb what is going on there is the propeller is the string is making it balance it and it keeps going around and around propeller keeps going around and around i would think about putting pennies in it or water i discovered that the boat can fit one thousand, two hundred and twelve pendulums in the little boat
myst_996424_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_019_comb i think if a has more pendulums and b has less pendulums i think it is just because a is bigger and b is shorter and if you put a twenty-five pendulums it would not sink that fast it would not sink but if you put b two thousand, four hundred and twenty-five pendulums it would sink we have been learning about boats and we have been putting pendulums in the boats and seeing how many pendulums can fit inside the little boat
myst_996424_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_023_comb i think it could connect to the capacity of the boat would be we can just measure measure em and it can be eighty millimeters or sixty-two millimeters three thousand, eight hundred and fifty-five millimeters about eleven and c could have ten and the shortest one could have eight
myst_996424_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_022_comb this data is all about a can how how how come what number like for example a is the number one cup and how many water or pennies it can how many water it can hold and then you just measure it and then the capacity you write eighty millimeters and on b it is the same thing on b the number b the cup and you just hold sixty-two millimeters
myst_996424_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_018_comb like for example if you put water in number eight you can put it would not sink that easily and b i think maybe c yes and d of course you can build them out of lifeboats you can build them out of wood
myst_996424_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_012_comb what is going on with that is that we have to learn about pendulums we have to learn how to p how to do science and and to learn more things what i learned about capacity was i know i know that we have to measure them and we have to see which one ha holds more pendulums or or which one holds more water
myst_996424_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_017_comb i think it c it is it is the biggest one can be like more thing more passengers than the other ones because if you put the same number on each one of em it would easily sink i have built mine out of pa out of paper cups
myst_996424_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_004_comb first you have to measure a the boat and see and put it in the water and you i think you measure thirty centimeters on them and then you would need to i i think i am not sure i think you have to measure thirty centimeters on them and we learned how to how many pendulums that it can hold and how much water it can hold no some of them hold ten or nine
myst_996424_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_020_comb when i when i noticed that a was not drowning that much i started putting more and more pendulums in em and when i drowned it i i got my answer really easily why i think they got a different number of pennies is because they cutted them shorter or longer bye it has been nice talking to you too i think it is balancing it and it is making the airplane fly
myst_996424_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_004_comb i think what that was all about was the string was all about seeing how fast the airplane could h fly and the string what you can also do when the parts are all working together is you can put the string into the straw and then you can just swing it across and it balance it and if it does not balance it is going to wiggle a lot
myst_996424_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_017_comb i think yes that the string has to be balanced because if it is not balanced the string may fall and it can wiggle and maybe it is not going to balance how you want it to be and maybe it is not going to work because the propeller is not m moving em a lot because it is wiggling
myst_996424_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_019_comb i think what is going on here is that the first one the la the second one the string is not well done and it is not perfect it is not straight and the first one is really straight and it balances as it balances it it balance it but the second one does not balance it because when it goes up it is going to go back down
myst_996424_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_018_comb i think that if the string is not balanced that well it is not going to work it is not going to spin it is it is it is just not going to work well maybe it is you have to put the airplane hanging attached to a string and you have to see how if it can fly
myst_996424_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_021_comb i think how i might affect it is because the second one is not really well done and if it goes up it is going to go back down and the first one is going to keep going straight i think the other things that are important when you are flying your plane is that it is really balanced and it is not wiggling a lot and that your propeller spins
myst_996424_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_011_comb i think what is important about the flying line is because and it attaches to it and it makes it balance and if e you do not have it on the bottom it is going to not go that fast i think the propellers are all about i am guessing that the propellers are to keep it balanced
myst_996424_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_011_comb i found out that you get you are measuring it and that you are seeing how far the brook goes and if it does not go that far you put the capacity you write the capacity and you you need a something to make it flip you need you need a stick and to measure it
myst_996424_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_010_comb these are all about measuring how far the brook goes and seeing if it goes that far systems are all about measuring and doing seeing seeing what how the system looks i think what is up with that object would be seeing how far it goes maybe
myst_996424_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_017_comb i think what is going on there it makes a good flipper system because it bounces off and it holds it tight and you do not want to bounce it off that high because the the stick can break it connects it by putting the stick on the bottom of the brick and if it goes far you just push it in you just take it out and it is and then just put it i am very good when you click it it bounces off
myst_996424_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_013_comb there is something on the on top of it and that you hold it you put it under the block and you just flip it and you see how far it goes we have been learning about flippers and we have been yeah we have been learning about flippers i think what the base is all about is measuring it and like seeing if it goes far you can think of we have seen a flipper system
myst_996424_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_026_comb i think what i would like to test is seeing seeing how far it goes and seeing the li the block can go be heavier it was important because they have to be good in have to put in good and if if they are not well done they can break you can the block that holds the stick it can be smaller or it can be heavier
myst_996424_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_016_comb i think what that is all about is measuring it and seeing how far it goes it makes it a system because the propeller is spinning around you can also do a smaller stick and see yeah you can do that too
myst_996424_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_020_comb i think you would just by for example you can say the brook holds the stick in and it makes it and you measure it and it makes it go in i think we have not
myst_018207_2014-10-08_12-04-19_LS_1.3_018_comb think the producers are the grass and the mushrooms and the bacteria and and the pine cone and that is all it is about all the animals eating each bacteria and fungi
myst_018207_2014-10-08_12-04-19_LS_1.3_006_comb what i think this is this is this is a food web get their energy from the consumer because they eat the consumer being a composers you eat the producers so that is how they get their
myst_018207_2014-10-08_12-04-19_LS_1.3_019_comb the consumers are the bunny and the bird and the lizard i am learning about caterpillars and decomposers and composers they get their energy cause they eat the producer the consumer the one that eats the producer and then it gets more energy they get their energy from the consumer because the consumer eats the producer
myst_018207_2014-11-03_09-31-48_LS_1.3_013_comb decomposer eats the consumer to get its energy because when the consumer is dead then the decomposer comes and and eats uhm the eats the consumer and then like for example lets say a bear died then i think fungi or a bacteria will come to kill it not to kill it to eat it
myst_018207_2014-11-03_09-31-48_LS_1.3_016_comb i think is this what uhm what they eat and what they get eaten by and what they get killed by and stuff pretty much we talk about decomposers consumers pretty much we are talking about uhm consumers decomposers and and producers
myst_018207_2014-11-03_09-31-48_LS_1.3_004_comb these are producers and these the consumers and these are the decomposers a producer means to me like it means to me that it makes its own food it does not eat like something it gets its energy from the sun
myst_018207_2014-11-03_09-31-48_LS_1.3_017_comb maybe some of them because some of them are herbivores some of them are carnivores and the omnivores are a consumer is the one that eats the producer to get its energy consumer eats the producer
myst_018207_2014-11-03_09-31-48_LS_1.3_011_comb they get their energy by eating the the producer the producer has their its energy it eats it is about producers uhm pretty much plants and uhm they are get their own food and the consumers they eat the producer so then they have more energy we have been learning about digest
myst_018207_2014-10-10_09-28-11_LS_1.3_004_comb i think it is about uhm it is about food web a human body is a system we have been making for our red they work together to support the human body they are all system
myst_018207_2014-09-16_09-05-06_LS_1.1_025_comb i see deserts and other lands that mostly have animals it is like lighting up it tells you things that they it has there is the motor the motor is one of the parts the most important part to make the car run
myst_018207_2014-09-16_09-05-06_LS_1.1_031_comb looks like a a food chain it is made out of out of the earth i remember that the like pointed other parts of earth maybe it represents the yellow must represent that it is like dry and the blue or purple mean it is pretty cold
myst_018207_2014-09-16_09-05-06_LS_1.1_037_comb the animals being like for example this grass says points the arrow to the bunny and that means that the bunny eats that grass they work together i think it is an ocean and island it is telling you what what part of the system it is
myst_018207_2014-09-16_09-05-06_LS_1.1_036_comb they are like saying what the animals thing is this is a part of the system i noticed that lots of bugs have lots of energy
myst_018207_2014-09-16_09-05-06_LS_1.1_034_comb i think a food web means to me that it is a web things are eaten by other animals this whole body is a system the biosphere is the land everything supports the car
myst_018207_2014-09-16_09-05-06_LS_1.1_008_comb they all work together to make the car work it is a system i think it is about things eating things like animals eating other plants the earth is pretty much have everything to make it a system
myst_018207_2014-09-16_09-05-06_LS_1.1_018_comb i think earth is a system because it has countries and things and that what makes it a system one circuit has two dimly lit light bulbs the other circuit has one brightly lit light bulb
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_008_comb well the d cell gives off the el electron that starts the flow of electrons all through through a whole circuit it is pretty cool how it works well in this shcematic there are two batteries and two light bulbs
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_012_comb well in the picture on the right with the two light bulbs the light bulbs are not lit very brightly in the picture on the left with one light bulb the light bulb is shining brightly well the pathway is a conductor or a wire a circuit is a circle of electricity basically
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_018_comb well the electricity has to flow from the the the energy flows about two times faster well in this circuit the battery gives off an electron that goes through the pathway to the light bulb through another pathway and back to the battery
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_022_comb when you flip it around the the di the direction of electricity goes the different goes the opposite way the negative side apparently the electrons just do not want to be in the negative side of the battery
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_025_comb well the blue dots are electrons are moving faster and the light bulbs are glowing brighter we have been studying electricity and magnetism the energy is going faster
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_030_comb well there is a lot of the l there is a lot of fast electricity flowing to the light bulbs so they light brighter than with one d cell where the electricity just is not flowing very fast and well that is about all i can say
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_003_comb through a pathway to a receiver and back again the light bulbs get brighter because the electricity is flowing faster well when you add more sources of electricity the electricity flows faster
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_028_comb well the light bulbs are more brightly lit because the electrons are moving no the electricity is moving faster and in the other one the electricity is moving slower so the light bulbs are not very brightly lit they are dimly lit
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_013_comb well i think there are less electrons flowing to each light bulb in the circuit with with the the one with two light bulbs there is less electricity flowing to the light bulbs in the other one there is a bunch of electricity flowing to the light bulb the light bulbs light brighter because the energy is flowing faster
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_001_comb good how are you
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_020_comb well the flow is not very large to the light bulb because the light bulb shares its electricity with another light bulb if the light bulb did not share its electricity with another light bulb there would be more electron more more electricity flowing to the light bulb and it would be brighter
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_026_comb well with two batteries the electricity flows faster through the wires and into the and into the light bulbs very fast and it goes through the light bulbs very fast and the light bulbs are glowing brighter
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_021_comb it is flowing from the negative side to the positive side well plus is against and minus is pointing out well the electricity flows through the light bul through the wires through the light bulbs and then back to the battery
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_016_comb they represent electrons and there are only like three of them in the light bulb at a time the bulbs light up brighter so if you have more than one d cell you get more light
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_015_comb well the electricity is is flowing around the cir this circuit and the the the light bulb is not getting that much electricity the light bulbs are only getting like thirty-three electrons at a time
myst_997679_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_033_comb well when you click on the d cell the well when you add a conductor to the circuit the circuit becomes completed if you add an insulator to the circuit well the circuit remains incompleted the brass ring is a conductor it does not spin
myst_997679_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_021_comb well there are two certain metals that attract magnents iron and steel well just about everything here that is metal is a conductor everything that is not metal is an insulator
myst_997679_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_012_comb well insulators they they do not transmit electrons through them
myst_997679_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_005_comb well a conductor is a an object that conducts electricity from the source to the receiver a closed circuit
myst_997679_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_011_comb well an insulator is something that an insulator is something that electricity does not flow through such as a sponge or a rock
myst_997679_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_013_comb well all the all the objects that well the they they did not really work at all we have been studying electricity and magnetism well this is a circuit with a switch in it no not all wer object work the same some objects are conductors others are insulators
myst_997679_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014_comb when you add an insulator to a circuit the the circuit is open
myst_997679_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_018_comb well the circuit is open when the circuit has an insulator in it if the circuit has a conductor in it the circuit is closed and if i said closed when there is an insulator in the circuit i meant open when there is an insulator in the circuit
myst_997679_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_008_comb well the wire must be from going th the wire of the mystery board must be going from point a to point b well you have to connect the wires on the mystery board so that they are touching the brads that the wire you are trying to find is right there they are conductors are not they
myst_997679_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_017_comb well th the wire is touching the two brads that you have touched to your wi your wires to it is pretty cool how it works you have to touch the wires to the brads that are connecting the wire the electricity flowing through the wires from the d cell to the light bulb
myst_997679_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_013_comb you put the wires on the brads do not you well it completes the circuit from this set up it tell me it tells me that brads a and c are connected by the wire so that if you touch the wires to brad a and c then you get the light bulb to light up
myst_997679_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_010_comb well it is showing where the wired you are trying to guess is so in this set up it is going from brad a to brad b well you have to figure out where the wires are in the little board it is a pretty cool experiment
myst_997679_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_020_comb well the electricity flows in a circle from the battery through the wire to the light bulb through the light bulb through the wires and back to the battery well we have been building circuits there is there is a wire going from point a to point d
myst_997679_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_019_comb this would be a closed or complete circuit well the wire has to be touching the the metal brads and then if you have the and if you have the wires on the right brads the light bulb will light up they are made of metal and are good conductors are not they
myst_997679_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_011_comb well sometimes it is really easy to guess where the wire is other times it is a little bit harder well the switch is off and open so the electricity is cut off the electricity flowing to the motor is cut off
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_023_comb well you have to have two wires coming from the motor one wire touching the positive side of the d cell and the other wire touching the negative side of the d cell
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019_comb well when you by the switch the switch is turned on so the electricity flows freely to the motor the electricity from the d cell flows freely to the motor
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_022_comb well it flows freely from the source in this case the d cell through the pathway the wires to the receiver or the motor
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_029_comb well the symbol on the bottom of the is the battery and then the symbols that kind of make the rectangular shape those are wires i i do not know what that symbol at the top is though it represents a light bulb
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017_comb the motor is just spinning arou the motor is using electricity to spin the to spin the rod that the little flag is on well it is the source of electricity for this whole circuit well you receive the electricity then transmit it through another wire back to the source
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_007_comb well it is the source of electricity for the circuit it is basically the thing that the circuit cannot work without
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_024_comb well it is using electricity that are flowing through the that is flowing through the wires to spin the flag spin the rod that the flag is on it shows a cir a circuit with a switch in it a switch or a circuit breaker
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_002_comb we have we have been studying magnetism and and electricity very cool only we have we have started to get into the electricity more we were doing magnetism earlier a d cell and a switch
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005_comb well a switch it kind of cuts off the electricity flowing from the d cell to the motor and that is how it was done well the circuit can not be broken by a switch well it represents a motor
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011_comb well they are the pathway they are what the electricity flows through from the battery or the source and it is how the electricity gets goes from the source to the receiver
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013_comb they carry the electricity from the battery to the to the switch in this case and then to the motor or light bulb and then back to the d cell this component is called the motor or receiver
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018_comb well the switch cuts off the electricity going from the d cell to the motor when it is off when the switch is on the electricity flows freely
myst_997679_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_026_comb well the battery is down at the bottom and then the wires are connected to that thingamabobber right up there they are called wires i think you have made a parallel circuit
myst_997679_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_015_comb well the circle with the loopy thing in it is the light bulb and then the the s the large line and then small line that is the battery each symbol represents a light bulb a bat a parallel circuit as i have said before we have been studying electricity
myst_997679_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011_comb it goes back into the d cell on the plus or positive side of the battery
myst_997679_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014_comb well in a parallel circuit the battery produces electricity with two wires that go that go to the light bulbs and then back to the positive side of the battery
myst_997679_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_009_comb in the parallel circuit there are two pathways in the other one there is only one pathway it represents a parallel circuit basically the electricity always flows from the minus side of the battery there is one for each receiver
myst_997679_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019_comb well this drawing this drawing shows a battery or a source a receiver and another receiver in a parallel circuit the electricity is flowing out of the negative end and going back in the positive end
myst_997679_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_005_comb well in the parallel circuit the light bulbs are bri brighter in the series circuit the light bulbs are dimmer a parallel circuit means the receivers each have a separate pathway to the battery
myst_997679_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_010_comb well the iron and steel are attracted to the magnetic field of the magnet and that is all i know good how are you
myst_997679_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_004_comb well there is a magnet hidden somewhere inside that mystery box and you have to find using a few tools a paper clip a magnet and a what is it what is it what is it you have to use a a a aw what is it well the magnets are attracted to iron
myst_997679_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_012_comb well when you put the paper clip by to the magnet you see where the magnet is because the paper clip snaps to and is attracted to the paper clip there is a magnet inside the mystery box so that is why it is s so mysterious we have been studying magnetism and electricity
myst_997679_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_021_comb you can figure out which pole of a magnet is which because you know the the magnet that is zero in the compass you know that it points north or south well to the north magnetic or the south magnetic both of them at the same time
myst_997679_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_015_comb well the magnetic field well iron and steel are attracted by the magnetic field to one of the poles of the magnet yeah i think it is i think the i think that is all i can really say right now
myst_997679_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_016_comb well well the the paper clip when you put it near the lower left hand corner it is attracted to the magnet well it is important that it was either iron or steel so that you could find the magnet with it because iron and steel are attracted to magnets
myst_997679_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_011_comb well the the paper clip when you drag it around the edge and you release the mouse then well when you release the mouse it will go toward the magnet if you are pretty by to it with the mouse
myst_997679_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_009_comb well you have got to have one wire on the positive side of the battery and one on the negative side of the battery it is pretty c cool when you get this experiment to work in fact it is really cool even if you do not get it to work really much at all
myst_997679_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_010_comb it generates electricity the electricity flows through it it sends off that little s the little flow of electrons that are needed first it gives it a little spark gives this experiment life
myst_997679_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_014_comb well it says that wires are the pathway it means that the wires are the path from the source the d cell we have been doing electricity and magnetism
myst_997679_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_013_comb and and they collect the and and it collects the electrons that flow through the light bulb they kind of it kind of well it is a battery two wires a light and a light bulb
myst_997679_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_012_comb well you have got to have a wire to send the electrons to the light bulb and you have got to have a wire to collect the electrons from the light bulb and it just goes through the battery up to the light bulb through and through and it keeps going in that cycle it is pretty cool really cool i do not really know how to tell you more about it
myst_997679_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_011_comb well it is the source of electricity for this experiment where you create a circuit it is the source of the it is the source of the experiment
myst_997679_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002_comb we have been studying electricity and magnetism very cool and we are just moving into the electricity unit we created an electrical circuit we created an electrical circuit yesterday it was cool
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_015_comb well we had a few kids passing out spacers a few kids passing out base magnets and a few kids passing out the regular magnets and a kid passing out the cups electricity and magnetism very cool
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_013_comb it becomes greater so the magnetic force becomes weaker maybe that is what i was going to say before or maybe i was just i do not know well the spacers are kind of breaking the magnetic pull so you need less washers
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005_comb well we were trying to see how many washers that needed to be in cup b to break the f the magnetic force of the two magnets and then we added spacers to help well to lower the number of washers necessary nice talking to you too bye
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006_comb it means the force between the magnets is much much much stronger how about stacking the washers on top of each other so that the same results will come nineteen washers necessary
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004_comb well the washers are trying to break the force of th they are trying to break the magnetic pull of the two magnets in cup a and then the spacers are also trying to help break the magnetic force well you should start with your control with zero spacers and see how many washers it takes to break the magnetic pole
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_014_comb because there is a bunch of because there is a bunch of space between the two magnets and the magnetic force is a bunch weaker than the well the one with zero say or the one with four
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_012_comb the weight in cup well no you see the weight in cup a is still greater than but the space between the two magnets is less because the more space between the magnets the i do not really know how to explain it i think i just forgot what i was going to say
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008_comb well in this experiment you are trying to break the pull of the two magnets well it increases the space between the two magnets so the magnetic pull becomes weaker
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009_comb the number of washers necessary decreases as the number of spacers increases so the more spacers there are the the weaker the magnetic pull
myst_997679_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_003_comb well there was a base magnet that sit on the scale right over near cup a and then we had another magnet to put on top of it inside cup a well the more of them there are the more of the spacers there are the less washers you need to break the magnetic pull of the magnets
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_013_comb the number of washers you pick up goes up the magnetic field created by the flow of electricity gets stronger with the more wraps you have wind wind the wire around the
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_025_comb it tells me that it is strong somewhat strong or very strong the electricity is creating a stronger magnetic field i think again that it would pick up fifteen washers
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_004_comb it must be a complete or closed circuit well it shows that the more wire wraps there are the more washers you can pick up only sometimes the number of washers picked up s can stay the same
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_014_comb well the more winds you have the more washers you pick up the data shows how many wire wraps it took to pick up how many washers well you have wound the wire around the core a one hundred times and it is able to pick up fifteen washers
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_020_comb it is a line graph of how many washers you pick up and how many wraps you put around the washer good how are you it means the wire the wire has gone a one hundred times around the core
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_008_comb the more winds you have the more washers you can pick up because the stronger the magnetic field is well you just wind the wire around it more times i would display my da data well there are ten wa there are ten winds here it only picks up three washers
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_002_comb they are magnets powered by electricity the more wire wraps you have there are more washers you can pick up
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_021_comb the numbers represent how many wire wraps you have and the words represent wire how many and the words are titling the numbers as the numbers the number of wire wraps you have
myst_997679_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_003_comb well there is a iron or steel core a wire that goes around the core and connects to a battery by recording the number of wraps and the number of washers it picks up the electricity flows and creates a magnetic field attracting the washers to the iron core
myst_997679_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012_comb you have to make sure the switch is on well the switch has to be connecting the two wire clips well when the electricity flows to the rivet magnetic field is created and the washers are either iron or steel so they are attracted to the core of the electro
myst_997679_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_022_comb well the role of a switch is very important because if the switch is well they tell you that when there when you make a circuit of electricity there is
myst_997679_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_018_comb when the when the metal part of the switch is connecting the two wire clips the magnet the washers are attracted to the rivet well it means that they are not always a magnet like a permanent magnet they are only a magnet sometimes
myst_997679_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024_comb electricity creates the emag the magnetic field so that the washers are attracted to the iron core you were saying that you were saying that the core is always iron the wires have to be wrapped around the rivet great how are y how is yourself
myst_997679_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005_comb because when the electricity flows there is a magnetic field it creates a magnetic fiel and magnetic field is created picking up washers well if you ha wrapped the core with wire a magnetic field is created iron the core has to be made of iro electricity must be in a circuit or flow in a circle
myst_997679_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016_comb because the switch is the component that well the electricity is flowing when you click on the wire clip because the switch closes the circuit
myst_997679_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015_comb well in an electromagnet the switch must be on in order for the magnetic field to be created if it is off well you might have gotten ripped off the switch pe plays the role of circuit breaker in this electromagnet
myst_997679_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_029_comb they have to be iron or steel we have been making electromagnets you twist it around a core the magnetic field is running along the nail therefore making it the nail have a magnetic field of its own for a little bit and then it can attract the paper clip from there
myst_997679_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_024_comb iron and steel can attract a magnet the nail must have been temporarily turned into a magnet so it can attract the paper clip the magnetic force is going to the opposite magnetic force so north is going to south and south is going to north so they do not want to stick together like that
myst_997679_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_019_comb there are these little compartments inside the nail that when that are usually all around the place and when i they are touching magnet they all align s and the nail is turned into a magnet for a little bit so that is why the paper clip is sticking to the nail i do not really know if i can tell you more about that
myst_997679_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_014_comb enough so i am not sure the magnetic field is traveling along the nail and is able to attract a paper clip with the power of the magnet you have to give the nail a little magnetic field so that it can attract the paper clip
myst_997679_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_023_comb magnet is touching the nail and the nail is temporarily becoming a magnet itself so it can attract the paper clip because the paper clip can can be attracted by a magnet i do not really i that is basically all i know about this so i can not really help you
myst_997679_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_020_comb well i do not know enough about nails to actually answer that question i do not really know i did not observe the thick stack
myst_997679_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_027_comb well the magnet will no the pa the nail when it touches the paper clip it can not do anything but when the magnet is touching the paper clip the magnetic field flows through the nail and is able to attract the paper clip it is probably not be being able to attract the paper clip very well so the paper clip is just falling off
myst_997679_2011-06-01_00-00-00_ME_1.2_025_comb do not really know i am stumped the hare the snake the hawk and the bird the beetle and the salamander they are a decomposer the bacteria and the mushrooms are fungi by eating each other or the producers to only eat plants they eat both plants and meat wait what
myst_022202_2014-12-16_11-49-50_LS_1.3_034_comb it is a decomposer they are worms they eat only dead stuff the grass and the pinecone they eat the producers the dead bodies and tress and stuff of dead animals and plants consumer or human herbivores eat only plants
myst_022202_2014-12-16_11-49-50_LS_1.3_003_comb the producers produce their own food consumers eat the producers and then decomposers decompose the the consumers produces its own food they produce healthy stuff for plants or is that earth worms a berry or type of plant a a carnivore
myst_022202_2014-12-16_11-49-50_LS_1.3_031_comb only eat they eat only decomposed stuff or dead stuff good i am very good when the consumers die they decompose their bodies and use it for other stuff nutrients
myst_022202_2014-12-16_11-49-50_LS_1.3_020_comb the consumers are humans bears lions and polar bears they eat meat the human and bear eat meat and berries or other food i think the herbivores eat grass and stuff carnivores eat other animals omnivores eat both eat decomposed animals and stuff i do not know
myst_022202_2014-12-16_11-49-50_LS_1.3_016_comb a mushroom or fungi they eat plants and only plants they all have interacting parts we have interacting parts and smaller systems inside of our body well they its like they like the rabbit eats the grass and the snake eats the rabbit and then the salamander and then the snake eats the salamander and then the snake dies and gets decomposed by bacteria
myst_022202_2014-12-16_11-39-59_LS_1.1_002_comb well actually i have already passed it it uses energy and it produces it and it moves because all the parts the way the energy travels they all have interacting parts they feed each other well the killed and then they eat them and then some and then the biosphere does that and blah blah
myst_022202_2014-12-16_11-39-59_LS_1.1_006_comb it is your body your body is a very big system with smaller systems inside of it the ecosystem is part of all of the biosphere the ecosystem is pretty much like producers decomposers consumers second consumers so on and so forth it has creatures that have adapted to live on it they it has a biosphere and they all work together to make the car move
myst_022202_2014-12-16_11-39-59_LS_1.1_008_comb the interacting parts a food web the digestive system a butterfly is made out of cells they are very cool they look like long strips of a muscle and there is little dots in between it breaks down food looks very different
myst_022202_2014-12-19_11-44-41_LS_2.3_029_comb it gives out waste which is disgusting human because we are not just one celled organisms like yeast brings food down to the stomach using muscles we both have digestive systems the intestines absorb all the nutrients and water for it to use for our body they help us move
myst_022202_2014-12-19_11-44-41_LS_2.3_022_comb breaking down food giving our bodies energy i am doing good looks like a factory they are made of cells everything is made out of cells every living thing is made we have a lot more cells than yeast to break down food and yeah the mouth breaks down the food our digestive system
myst_022202_2014-12-19_11-44-41_LS_2.3_024_comb the food down to the stomach it brings the food down to the stomach i do not know i forgot we did a yeast experiment they look like nerves more food chains and food webs but we also studied omnivores carnivores and herbivores
myst_022202_2014-12-16_12-04-57_LS_2.1_005_comb i think the animal cracker had stuff in it that gave nutrients to the yeast so now it is alive very very much so plants do not need hamburgers but they need food but they produce their own food by using sugar sunlight and water vapor
myst_022202_2014-12-16_12-04-57_LS_2.1_009_comb that it needs three simple needs sunlight water and i forgot the third one the plant also needs sunlight i think it is about yeast and getting its nutrients yeast animal crackers which have sugar and flour and water
myst_022202_2014-12-16_12-04-57_LS_2.1_008_comb one has been in a dark bag the other has been in a light bag one has been the darker one has been in no light well a little bit of light and the other one has been in the light the one that is darker that one has been in a dark bag the one that is brighter has been in a light bag then we switched them around and i have not known yet
myst_022202_2014-12-16_12-04-57_LS_2.1_006_comb they are small they all are one cell each little piece is one cell each little piece of yeast is one cell they have different names fitting their their suit whatever parallel that is what the leaf called and has parallel veins
myst_022202_2014-12-19_11-56-26_LS_3.1_007_comb i do not know i forgot i have a short term memory sometimes it is showing the water going up to a to get into the leaves and the orange is going down to help the roots which is and the orange is sunlight and the blue is water
myst_022202_2014-12-19_11-56-26_LS_3.1_003_comb are all green and have little vines veins things coming out of them all from the middle of them that is a bag around a leave that shows water vapor coming off of the leaf which is very useful getting food from place to place and making food we are learning about leaves plants
myst_022202_2015-01-22_11-28-34_LS_3.4_016_comb they are well pretty much the the vein is delivery system the heart is delivery system then the veins are the roads oxygen uhm food well nutrients and i do not know what the other one getting oxygen to your cells and getting carbon dioxide out they both have hearts and veins the parts of the respiratory system
myst_022202_2015-01-22_11-28-34_LS_3.4_030_comb they are tubes that carry air and branch off into the trachea and go deep into the lungs and they pretty much hold the air sack pretty much the highways for blood and they are called veins and artery the respiratory system is responsible for getting oxygen into your body and carbon dioxide out blood vessels the heart and blood
myst_022202_2015-01-22_11-28-34_LS_3.4_028_comb it is a sheet of muscle that sits under the lungs when the diagram contracts the lungs draw air in and the diaphragm when it relaxes the lungs expel air out the end it takes and it filters the air that will go into the lungs cells are dropping off carbon dioxide and picking up oxygen
myst_022202_2015-01-22_11-28-34_LS_3.4_021_comb uhm pretty much the blood pumps the heart pumps blood through the veins the veins deliver nutrients and oxygen water to the cells and then the arteries bring it back to the heart to get pumped out again uhm the same thing uhm the pump
myst_022202_2015-01-22_11-28-34_LS_3.4_007_comb that the heart like one side of the heart pumps all the way through the body the other side just pumps to the lungs and back the circulatory system uhm to get the carbon dioxide out of your body and get the uhm uhm oxygen into your body so your body can move and stuff give blood to the heart and take it away air going in and out of the lungs and everything working
myst_022202_2015-01-22_11-28-34_LS_3.4_022_comb it is the it is the lungs that pretty much means that it is the respiratory system and yeah all the systems uhm the circulatory system blood is going in and out oxygen which helps our body well not helps makes our body live it is going to float because maybe one has more salt than the other or it might have more water
myst_012028_2013-12-06_09-27-31_MX_2.4_002_comb we have been using different waters and different solutions it would be more dense because then things would float the density has is the cork is lighter than the penny and so it floats they will not mix but then with others they might mix can you repeat that
myst_012028_2013-12-06_09-27-31_MX_2.4_014_comb they are separating so the denser one will stay on the bottom and then the lighter one will the less dense one will stay on the top it has six more it has six more grams than the red and ten more grams than the green
myst_012028_2013-12-06_09-27-31_MX_2.4_005_comb it is heavier because it it sinks it is very concentrated because they can not get through each other they put solution a in first and then solution b and then it mixed and got that they might mix
myst_012028_2013-12-06_09-27-31_MX_2.4_004_comb that it would take that it would salt can make something float they will sink or they will mix the less concentrated solutions will float and then the more concentrated solutions will sink because they are heavier there is more salt we use these
myst_012028_2014-03-11_12-28-15_SRL_3.2_030_comb i know where you live this is a scale to see how hard rocks are we did this in class this is so sad i know where you live nothing happens here goes the nail that they are not rocks
myst_012028_2014-03-11_12-28-15_SRL_3.2_040_comb the rock rubbing against the tile minerals go into rocks but rocks do not go into minerals but i am not a mineral no but the diamond can we use them it made a mark why does it always make a mark
myst_012028_2014-03-11_12-28-15_SRL_3.2_038_comb rock can scratch the tile one ingredient for like rocks they have more than one we have been doing this
myst_012028_2014-03-10_12-24-33_SRL_2.1_013_comb the stream table and we have been doing these in class erosion and earth materials are carried away i do not know erosion and it is in a delta and a canyon it is what is left after two thing collide it is where either one thing or two things collide to make something another thing and whatever is left after they collide is erosion
myst_012028_2014-03-10_12-24-33_SRL_2.1_007_comb the first one because i see a cut bank it is a stream table there are little islands there are cut banks and little rivers down the rock deposition and erosion it is the delta it is a valley and when we had the flood the water came out and left a trail of water i mean mud
myst_012028_2014-02-18_10-17-21_SRL_1.3_014_comb rain freeze and once breaks apart it hits the cliff breaks up hits other rocks breaks and then once the rain comes it would erode and grow stuff with the sandstone the rain freeze does not does not do huge damage
myst_012028_2014-02-18_10-17-21_SRL_1.3_009_comb what is that what is that what is that what is it there is water acid rain that is hitting the limestone and disintegrating it the the air trapped into the the air trapped in the rock are is floating up afterward
myst_012028_2014-02-18_10-17-21_SRL_1.3_016_comb hello excuse me can you please repeat that it is it is a acid rain is coming down hitting it and making a tunnel through the lime
myst_012028_2014-02-18_10-17-21_SRL_1.3_003_comb well the limestone is more it has a better has a more is more reactant to the vinegar than the basalt the rocks have turned brown and it took time we have been learning about weathering chemical weathering physical weathering about vinegar how it can change rocks rain and precip
myst_012028_2014-02-18_10-17-21_SRL_1.3_027_comb acid rain and also erosion that the limestone after acid rain after a year still had it abraded and eroded the salt dissolves but then when you put it in the coffee filter it comes back and the salt will stay that when you put each fifty gram of water will
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_039_comb it is going into the it is going into the sky or well you are adding water to salt in the bottom one and then it looks like it dissolves and then on the top one it looks like you added water with sand or powder and they turned the water brownish that they will get heavier if you mix it with a bigger number it is a mixture
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_036_comb i do not know the solvent is the water wait yeah the solvent is the water because without the water you would just be pouring salt into a cup and then it helps it because you would help it with helping the salt with the water that is a mixture because it can be filtered out
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_022_comb i do not know wait is it a solution well it is playing a role because without the water it would just be powder and if you just had the water there would be no solution yes yes you can
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_020_comb when you mix them they become a bigger mass because two solutes have mixed the same thing happened that each mass is the same the salt is dissolving because some
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_006_comb well a salt can not dissolve well the salt will dissolve but then the sand will will not dissolve because it is a solid it is it is the salt crystals because the water has gone out and then the salt crystals are left because the water it does it never goes away because it is evaporation
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_010_comb well salt can dissolve into the water it will just go into the water it will not because it will not go away because if you try and evaporate the water it will just come back when the water goes away well we have been doing this solutions unit and we have been learning about solutes and solutions and mixtures
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_007_comb the salt has dissolved because it can be dissolved it was a solid and is a liquid but then so then it is important because then you can see how it changed we have learned that a solution is not always a mixture but a mixture is not always a solutions can we please go on
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_040_comb it is evaporation and it helps it evaporate the water to evaporate or a hot dry climate or for sun to hit it i do not know good i do not really know that it is a solution i do not know the flour makes the water go more
myst_012028_2013-11-13_09-10-27_MX_1.2_014_comb that fifty that without one of them it would not make the other so wait that without a solvent or a solute it would not make a solution or that it all mixes together a bigger form of a solution i was right
myst_012028_2013-12-04_08-45-27_MX_2.2_009_comb one will be heavier than another solution three is more concentrated than solution one because it weighs more which one is heavier on a scale three is the most concentrated there all of em are different because one has different mass and it is heavier
myst_012028_2013-12-04_08-45-27_MX_2.2_012_comb it would make it heavier blah blah blah okay we have been doing mixtures and solutions a lot solution one and solution two one is one thousand and ten grams heavier than the other one that flat is meandering and that steep is going straight down the steep slow is going very flat fast and then the flat slope is going very slow cause it has to go around corners
myst_012028_2014-03-11_10-48-15_SRL_2.2_012_comb flood will go much more because it goes faster it differs because one is all the way down to the bottom and one is not even close to the bottom we have been doing this exact same thing and we have been doing stream tables the water has gone up
myst_012028_2014-03-11_10-48-15_SRL_2.2_013_comb flood will go faster because it has a bigger hole and then standard will go slower and be just a little canyon and flood will spread out it is higher in the flood the water raises when there is a flood i think slow slow one is very deposited and one it not plates in the earth moving
myst_012028_2014-02-10_10-00-44_SRL_1.1_010_comb they are from different places they all have properties of soil zero my god they are different and the most dense ones are on the bottom and the least dense ones are on the top they are all different soil we are learning about soil what did you say i do not know i can not see them that there is a magnifying on the bottom of the screen that was my friend he is so smart
myst_012028_2014-02-10_10-00-44_SRL_1.1_007_comb they are mixing together and there is like a topping of silt all of these all of these components mix together to make soil they have they have different properties of soil they are the same cause they are made up of the same thing
myst_012028_2014-02-10_10-00-44_SRL_1.1_014_comb they are from different places so they will be different and also that that people will farmers will be like farmers have different things than mountains because deserts have do not have deltas or the mountains or the farm land or the delta well first of all you shook it up so then it is going to mix together and then it is going to settle and it is going to turn different
myst_012028_2013-12-20_08-49-43_MX_4.1_038_comb the green liquid is turning the green baking soda and calcium chloride it has bubbled and the once you put the baking soda in it reacted and then it reacted and then fizzed i do not know
myst_012028_2013-12-20_08-49-43_MX_4.1_014_comb they are farther away and then the reactants are closer together it had bubbled when you poured them both together so that they must be have different ones and then when they are mixed they will bubble we have been doing products and reactions baking soda and calcium i would nothing is wrong with them
myst_012028_2013-12-20_08-49-43_MX_4.1_030_comb it is pretty and it is pink and it is calcium chloride plus baking soda plus water equals it fizzes it fizzed and i do not know why
myst_012028_2013-12-20_08-49-43_MX_4.1_015_comb there is there is the baking soda molecules are closer together and the vinegar molecules are they are products no they are reactants and they react off of each other to make a product it is a precipitate
myst_012028_2013-12-20_08-49-43_MX_4.1_016_comb the reactants mixed with baking vinegar mixed with baking soda fizzes no because they are already mixed together no because you need to add water to make it a chemical reaction
myst_012028_2013-12-20_08-49-43_MX_4.1_031_comb there there is a reaction because the two reactants mixed with each other to make a another product that is pink no there is nothing happening just ice getting put in a glass and the glass is sweating
myst_012028_2013-12-20_08-49-43_MX_4.1_012_comb there is vinegar and baking soda and the little molecules will had mixed and made another product there is citric acid baking soda and calcium chloride less powder or more water spoons are floating
myst_012028_2013-12-03_09-58-10_MX_2.1_020_comb you could either take out fifty milliliters of or of water or add fifty milliliters of they are going to be harder sweeter they are switched it would be more diluted because without the added three spoonfuls it is going to be taste diluted and bitter
myst_012028_2013-12-03_09-58-10_MX_2.1_021_comb the amount of water will make it more concentrated by taking out water when it is darker it will most likely have more more solute or when it is lighter it will have less solute
myst_012028_2013-12-03_09-58-10_MX_2.1_009_comb if it is darker or if you see it and it has more solvent solute particle they look sweeter and they look denser when it was weighed higher and it was heavier either it is sweeter or bitter
myst_012028_2013-12-03_09-58-10_MX_2.1_008_comb zero there is way more there is one darker and then there is way more particles on the one on the right and the ones on the left is way more concentrated can you repeat that you get water or take water away
myst_012028_2014-02-12_10-05-16_SRL_1.2_009_comb it helps to know about what can happen when freezing cause a huge boulder cause of a little crack and then a whole boulder could crush they were in the river a ton and then they got washed down and hit with other rocks and then just got eroded until it did not it could not first they were
myst_012028_2014-02-12_10-05-16_SRL_1.2_014_comb because it could not get the top off and then it had no where to go but out could because ice expands when it does it could just go it could just break anything at once i do not know the bigger pieces of rock do not have much much things to crash into them for them to erode so they are going to stay the biggest but then the
myst_012028_2014-02-12_10-05-16_SRL_1.2_006_comb it fell off and then it fell off the cliff broke into then hit a couple rocks and then splashed into the water because the delta gravel has been there way more than the boulder have so they have been just getting hammered with other rocks and getting pushed downstream wind knocked the boulder off the cliff and it broke and then it fell into the water and broke and eroded
myst_012028_2014-02-12_10-05-16_SRL_1.2_002_comb well we been doing vinegar evaporating dishes where we put rocks and vinegar and seeing what chemical weathering is once it fell into the water it hit maybe another stone and then it started weathering by the water the boulders are the biggest the
myst_012028_2014-02-12_10-05-16_SRL_1.2_011_comb water had gotten into the cracks into that rock if it had any cracks or if it had this one tiny crack it could have gotten into that crack frozen and then it could of broken up more i have been seeing the water is getting higher and the salt is saturating the water and then after the filter it is leaving it is leaving stuff it is leaving salt behind that
myst_012028_2013-12-18_09-52-12_MX_3.2_013_comb because it has thirty-six grams we have been making solutions and i do not care one is sugar and one is citric acid i said a epsom salt i have said that like twenty times now substance one i said
myst_012028_2013-12-18_09-52-12_MX_3.2_004_comb we they are trying to saturate the water we have been using these materials same chart in our science notebooks there was a bag and then there was two there was two solutes and then you put the water in there and the bag fizzed and went down
myst_012028_2014-01-10_13-22-21_MX_4.2_018_comb there is a chemical reaction on scale and one is heavier the than the other because one has more water and one is has more solid if it would fizz or if it turned hot or cold that science is weird if a product is left the first can has solute and then the second has none at all
myst_012028_2014-01-10_13-22-21_MX_4.2_015_comb we have not been talking about that that when they were mixed together they either blew up the bag and fizzed you are putting salt the you closed and it went to the air molecules are trapped inside the closed bag but let out and it balanced inside the open bag one with the bag closed is weighs more than the one with the bag open cause it has air inside it trapped inside of it
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-47-32_MX_4.2_018_comb you are weighing two on two different scales you are pouring salt into the it did not well no i did not there was too much it did not do anything it just like stayed there is reactions the calcium chloride and the
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-47-32_MX_4.2_014_comb i see blue i see gray and i see silver the gas is silver the gas is yellow we have to pick which one is a solute and a solute disappears and and evaporates and loses some of it is properties property dry mixtures and how to separate mixtures
myst_014018_2013-12-20_13-20-54_MX_1.3_006_comb there is salt gravel from what it looks like iron and powder they are separating the gravel from the rest of the mixture mixtures and solutions cause there is a magnetic force inside the mixture i was so right
myst_014018_2013-12-20_13-20-54_MX_1.3_003_comb there are things that if you put multiple things together and they have the same properties they that since the tooth pins that they that the safety pins are magnetic they get picked up by the magnet the safety pins are magnetic the others are not
myst_014018_2013-12-20_13-20-54_MX_1.3_011_comb cause the gravel will not go through it but the water will sorry okay the safety clips are magnetic and there the only metal in those magnetism and magnets i was right if the water is getting filtered through the screen but the gravel can not go through the screen
myst_014018_2013-12-20_13-20-54_MX_1.3_020_comb because there is magnetic properties in the metal of the safety clips i do not know it is darker or lighter what did you say grape fantastic stuff getting poured and mixed with water there was less powder go in the water and the and and earth is balanced
myst_014018_2014-01-10_12-29-41_MX_2.1_009_comb one is darker than the other it will be sweeter the put less water and add different amounts of water in them the taste okay i noticed something wrong there is a three spoonfuls for the six spoons and there is a six spoonfuls of the three spoonfuls a chemical reaction occurred because the water turned green with the drip of green blue
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-30-07_MX_4.1_036_comb it shows that it is a chemical reaction and it is important cause chemical reactions are they are different colors and in different shapes which means there are different molecules and different types i it does not look but i think i i think there was calcium chloride baking soda and water it gets purple zero my gosh that is so
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-30-07_MX_4.1_037_comb it started fizzing so and when it is fizzing like that it shows that a chemical reaction is taking place i forgot marni a chemical reaction the water or the substance is poured into the middle one made it turn purple
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-30-07_MX_4.1_040_comb it just turned green that was gray right now okay before they all the atoms were blue and they had micke mouse ears which means they are water atoms and the sodium hydroxide and the hydraulic acid make two of the blue atoms purple and only had one small
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-30-07_MX_4.1_008_comb shut up and repeat that peter shut up participate is that what it is called there was a reaction that was like the water the stuff turned purple and it was really really cool and i like chemical reaction just because the water went up the ice cubes like just made the water go up there was nothing happening except the water going
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-30-07_MX_4.1_043_comb when you broke the glow when you like like put like the snapped the glow stick the fluid inside of it mixed together and it made a chemical reaction so it glowed a chemical reaction it is fizzing for a long long long time there was a chemical reaction going because the bike had rust on it at the end of the year
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-30-07_MX_4.1_026_comb the the sodium hydroxide and the hydroxide acid made some of the atoms inside the water purple the vinegar is reactant the baking soda is reactant and the and the water like the cup is a product can you repeat that
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-30-07_MX_4.1_016_comb there are hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the vinegar i see in the vinegar i see oxygen and the atoms must be different two of the atoms are blue two of the atoms are blue
myst_014018_2014-02-07_12-30-07_MX_4.1_035_comb it fizzed and then it went down and now it is clear you are pouring the vinegar and they are actually baking soda into a water and then it is fizz a chemical reaction i think there is cause it is turning the water is turning purple the mixtures and solutions it is saturated it is saturated saturated saturated saturated
myst_014018_2014-01-31_12-31-24_MX_3.1_006_comb science sucks and i hate it so i am not going to talk about it what repeat repeat we measured the salt solution and then we misused it by fifty cause we need fifty grams of water
myst_014018_2014-01-31_12-31-24_MX_3.1_016_comb the okay it is getting really like the water got saturated and it was full and completely full of salt and it can not hold anymore salt when it and so it the salt starts going on the in the bottom and that is called saturated saturated whatever i do not care
myst_014018_2014-01-31_12-31-24_MX_3.1_021_comb you are they are measuring it is measuring how much grams are in the salt it is measuring how much like grams are in a solution it is measuring how many grams there is still some salt left at the bottom of the jar it is getting like it can not hold the sugar any longer
myst_014018_2014-01-31_12-31-24_MX_3.1_018_comb they are doing the exact same thing but just with sugar it is getting the solid is getting poured into it and there is still some salt on the bottom and i call that saturated i hate science and science sucks i do not know what we were learning
myst_014018_2014-01-31_12-31-24_MX_3.1_014_comb it is saturated it can not hold any more the water is saturated it can not hold any more salt in it cause it ingredients two ingredients that one dissolves or disappears into the other one i think the second one is the least concentrated the third one is more concentrated than the second
myst_014018_2014-01-10_12-42-12_MX_2.2_008_comb the twenty gram solute will weigh more than the ten gram solute the second is the most diluted or the least concentrated the density and the darkenss and the lightness of each mixtures and solutions one is a salt water solution and one is a grape solution
myst_014018_2014-01-10_12-42-12_MX_2.2_016_comb i think the first is the most concentrated and the second and the third is in the middle the ones to the right are getting denser
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-43-30_MX_1.2_010_comb solutions one disappears in the mixture i mean in a a solution it it disappears and in a mixture both the properties stay the same i am learning about mixtures and solutions it goes inside the molecules of the water the citric disappeared into the water
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-43-30_MX_1.2_001_comb good hate your face why are you so ugly what is your name cause it is a solution and science is cool and the water and and the grams are getting measured to see how many grams the water weigh
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-43-30_MX_1.2_025_comb the the the put poured flour into the water and then they are using a filter to separate the flour from the water it is getting bigger and heavier even though the salt disappears it is still inside the water
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-43-30_MX_1.2_012_comb the solvent in this picture is salt and the reason the role the role it plays inside the solution is it is the part that disappears the salt is getting in the she is really creepy
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-43-30_MX_1.2_014_comb the one the thing on the left is separated and the equal and the right side is all mixed together and it weighs what all of them the salt disappeared after being mixed and the sand did not the solute is the salt and it disappears after being mixed with the water
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-43-30_MX_1.2_023_comb i do not know in a mixture yes in a solution no what does the fox say the salt disappeared and now it is going into the filter i do not know i do not know cause i am not very smart and i am only in kindergarten because they are different they have different molecules and they have different mass
myst_014018_2014-01-31_12-41-13_MX_3.2_014_comb yeah it does let us say something you we call it a solution some are round and some are have are skinny and some are kind of
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-30-24_MX_1.1_012_comb the trail mix has been pulled apart from being a no that can you repeat my sentence i hate
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-30-24_MX_1.1_006_comb i see a nuts i see paper clips i see marbles and i see a we call them mixtures and mixtures are important and i do not know why the marbles after getting like from the water they are kind of drying off and the water is not touching the marbles anymore
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-30-24_MX_1.1_015_comb the marbles have been separated from the water by using a filter the one on the left is a mixture the they are a mix what gender are you it has been taken apart
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-30-24_MX_1.1_004_comb salad is a mixture of fruits and vegetables the the nuts are a mixture and the marbles are mixtures the waters it is like it disappeared and dissolved
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-30-24_MX_1.1_020_comb it like when you pulled them we pulled all the mixtures apart by using different the salt will dissolve into the water and this type of mixture is called a solution they all are mixtures can you repeat what you
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-30-24_MX_1.1_025_comb the salt it like disappears and goes into the molecules of the water okay it has been taken apart and why that is important is it is not a mixture anymore
myst_014018_2013-12-13_12-30-24_MX_1.1_017_comb the screen the screen the marbles away from the water and the water away from the marble the the salt mixture it disappeared well and dissolved while the other two mixtures the contents inside of it had the same property
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_006_comb that is like when you if you connect like when you connect a lightbulb it like it is like connecting a motor to the battery and the other wire the other wire to the other clip of the battery and you connect it to both of if you put both of the wires together instead of just putting it on the clip it will j
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004_comb c or a b or c d and a and b and after you were done with that we ha we at least had to do two we got to switch around with people we have a battery wire and a lightbulb with the lightbulb kit you had to put in like
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_009_comb well first we can put the battery in where the battery goes and then we can get the wire and connect it to the battery is clip and then we put the lightbulb carrier where the lightbulb carrier goes and then we can connect the wires well the battery is giving energy to the lightbulb so the lightbulb is lighting up
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_004_comb well one part of the wire is in the on the bottom of the lightbulb and it is connected to the battery and the other wire is connected to the other side of the battery and it is connected to the lightbulb to metal well i i think it is about like the battery giving out energy it is like a circuit
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_010_comb well first when it starts it is going the same way then it turns and then it goes different and then fi first like first when it comes out of the battery it is going a different way and then when it is coming back it is going a different way any part that is the metal the elec electricity would go through there
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_008_comb yeah well the elec well the battery is giving energy to the lightbulb where it is in the in the metal and it is going through and down the lightbulb back to the battery and it is going back to the lightbulb cause if it was not touching the metal it would the energy would not go through so the lightbulb will light
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_015_comb well since i clicked on the battery it is going the opposite way if i click on the battery again it is going to go a different way it is going the same way because when wherever it starts it is going around and coming back to the same place from the minus yes because if you put it the wrong way when you are putting in on a battery the battery will not work
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002_comb well the battery is about if you did not have the battery you could not get the energy to light up the light bulb and it would not work it starts on the battery and it goes zero all around the wires to the lightbulb and it comes back and it and it goes through th the same way again every time
myst_997277_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_2.1_005_comb becau if if you did not put it in the metal like where the me metal was it the it would not light up we tried to try to stick magnet we put magnets below and try to stick another magnet with it after we were done with that we put a magnet below the paper again and then we not two magnets only one and then we put paper clips on top of it
myst_997277_2008-17-11_00-00-00_ME_1.2_040_comb it helped us learn more about magnets because it it helped us learn that if you scratch something that could stick to a magnet and if you match it with that the same thing like a nail if you scratch it in the magnet and if you match it with another nail you would still it would magnetize
myst_997277_2008-17-11_00-00-00_ME_1.2_042_comb the magnet below the mag the magnet that is below is moving the magnet that is on top so so if it was more thicker then the magnet would not move because it is too thick and if it since it is like perfect you could sch the magnet could still have enough me energy that it will go the magnet is moving the paper clip around the paper
myst_997277_2008-17-11_00-00-00_ME_1.2_050_comb yes and war is bad too but peace is really good so we made p posters a for peace it was to get enough energy in the m m in the paper clip that it would stick to another one today we learned about peace how it is good to have peace and no drugs and all those other stuff today i made posters peace posters
myst_997277_2008-17-11_00-00-00_ME_1.2_028_comb because the magnet has enough energy that it is energy is stronger than the thick paper so when you put the magnet below and you put a paper clip it will still stick because of the magnet is pow it was fun because we tried to s make a magnet go through paper to test if it would get connect to another magnet i do not know yes it did because of the scratching i do not know
myst_997277_2008-17-11_00-00-00_ME_1.2_024_comb they were trying to like test us if the paper clip could stick still with the paper in the middle and the magnet below yes we tried to scratch paper clips on on the magnet to see if it would stick to other paper clips
myst_997277_2008-17-11_00-00-00_ME_1.2_018_comb i meant like you put a magnet on top of paper and put another magnet and try to see if it would stick and you put another and you put a magnet on top on below the paper and you put paper clips yes i really was they are important because if you j d have had them in the wrong place the mo motor will not start working
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_058_comb well if you have them in order then you will always work but if you if y if the wires were not in the clip they will not would not work because you have to hold it with your hand and it would still work but it would not work that as great as putting them in the clip it will work always but if you like if y if you do not stick the motor into the clips and you just make it touch it will not work because the the wires will come out quickly
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_062_comb well when the switch is open it is it is a complete circuit but when the switch is not open it is like half a circuit because the what you are trying to make is not working and when the switch is open what you are trying to make is working well the switch you have to put it under one of the clips and then the motor will start t start running
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014_comb well the battery one part of the battery is connecting to the place where you put the like one part of the p like well there are two different wires and one wire f from the battery is plus sign is going to the the wire carrier and the other wire from the battery is going to from the motor is going to the battery and there is this other one where you put it and the battery carrier from the wi from the motor
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_042_comb ink the motor will not stay on for a long time if you put them in the wrong place the motor will not work well if you have to have like the wires in the right place if you had them in the wrong place first you will not get enough energy to make the motor move and then it would not work too
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_046_comb well the switch when you put the wires well the switch when you put everything in place you s put the switch under one of the wires and then the motor will start working because of the energy from it like from the wire from one part of the wire it is going th to the switch and then when you put it under they both are working so and then it the motor works
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_004_comb today like we were studying about electricity and then we were trying to make a motor like spin and then we first we got to do it with battery and the motor is wire that is it and then we got a switch and then later we put the battery in where the battery was supposed to go and the s motor and then we got a switch we had to connect the wires and make it l into a switch so it would turn on and off
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_026_comb well because of the battery the motor has enough power that it will start going well like we when we got the switch there were two wire carriers one for the extra wire that we got and one for the motors so we got we had to put them in there to make the motor go or else it would not go
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_044_comb well it is important because when you attach the wires and you put everything in the right place then the motor will start working and you learn more about motors
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_034_comb well an electric circuit is when you pu connect the motor is one of the motor is wire to the battery next to the battery and one of the other wire re into in front of the battery and one of the motor is right behind it and when you put the the electric circuit since the battery has enough power of the wires it goes through and then it m and then it th it makes the motor spin
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_028_comb the power is like since you are connecting one of the wires of the motor well the switch was like you was trying to like put it below the wires so the battery the motor could continue and spinning and then after a while we had to stop because the battery we wanted to save the battery
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_048_comb well they are a differ there is a different way you can do it you could just get the battery and the motor and put one wire of the motor underneath the batter i think a circuit is like a circle because were the c i r is par what starts you what starts with a circle so like a circuit is a circle like right now there is like in front of me there is a circuit
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_054_comb always because it depends on what place you put em ese plus sign and then you put it on and then you put it on the wire wire carrier and then you get the stick and then you put it under it
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_030_comb the clip that is next to the battery the battery is power inside the battery is going to lit and then the other part of the wire is going there and then the one of the motor is wire is going in the clip and then when you pull put that underneath one of them you can n start the m all the right places in the it means like you have to put them in the clips because if
myst_997277_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_050_comb minus place and one part of and then the other part of the wire on the plus place so it will still work you do not have to do it with the switch like you have to do the same number as the little one the syringe big syringe like that you have to measure it like same same well like the water to put with the syringe like that so like shot and then we put it yeah huh
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_030_comb what number was it
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_050_comb because we saw like the water was coming up up up up that is what that is how we knew we we shaked it a little bit and then we saw was heavy if it was heavy we put it on s something to measure it if it is w if it was heavy or yeah a little bit
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_056_comb so it could not drop water because we could not know which number three or a one hundred the cup one hundred no yeah but the syringe had big syringes and little syringes
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_068_comb our teacher puts the num the number which people does it if they have the low number or the base number because we got it with she put it a little bit of water when we got it yeah like that everybody everybody had the same number and some had the different number
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_064_comb that th we put water n how many it is it heavy or ho which number like how is it yeah you can measure it down like we can measure it we measure in my team we measure it up but some teams they measure it like low low yeah
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_042_comb measuring water measuring the soda cans and how much water can take putting how much water does it take in the soda can it is not the same number yeah i do not re i do not remember the number anymore
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_106_comb it sometimes falls off because tiny like where the sky falls like the the the when it rains those it it falls a little bit like that yeah it drips sometimes and so we put some a little bit more and then we do it quickly and then we spray it like that it is fun
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_040_comb because th it is more better than measure it down because we would not know which number was it like it is too hard i do not know like our t we were putting our teacher put in the water and then we did not know but we f when we got the we we heard that there was water a little bit water so that is why
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_026_comb bec because we could not know it is it could drop like the water and then we will have different numbers yeah we just had to do it with a syringe yeah s yeah more yeah we got the little one yeah
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_052_comb we did it so we can not know if it was little water or or big n water we we did not want to shake it so the wa s if it was up and the water could fall off and we did not know how which number so we put it on something and we measured it how many cause it was heavy
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_058_comb like like if it is sm the small number or big number like how many is in the w in the canned how many water so we told the teacher why do they have and then we did not know how like i think we did not have much syringes like little syringes yeah
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_024_comb we put it the syri we got this cup with with measure we got some water and then we took the syringe we took the water and then we put it in the can we were measuring i do not know we just did that that it had water on so know when we got it yeah
myst_996272_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_032_comb zero we just wanted it to use that and not something more big like just soda cans we put some water like that and then we put in the can teacher wanted to get different numbers she does not i think she does not want to write the same number all the time i think which is the number
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_070_comb our or like we will show them again like because we sometimes people put em in the paper they copy it the that and then they cut it out and then they show them
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_100_comb we had that homework a homework and it had we had to measure things you have to put the name what it is called and what length you take a guess two guesses and then you measure it and if you were wrong then you just put the answer like one of those take them
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_028_comb because do you see this it is like it goes this way if it goes this way it is that one is lighter and that one is heavier the little box no th yeah the little box the cork was we had to put it took like fourteen yeah we got like we put the answer in
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_062_comb no because some will grab big ones some will grab little ones because like it is bigger a little bit and it has like a thing inside and this one is lower and this one is higher show them in a journal like no none of those zero yes some of those we only got the little ones yeah
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_032_comb it is more heavier than the lighter yeah some things that are heavy and some things that are low we had the little blocks and we s little tiny blocks and let us see how many blocks do we take the p paper clips and the boxes same of them yeah
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_020_comb because it it it has like a thingie that you know if it goes this way or that way like a stick it is more easier than paper clips because paper clips are more and because you have to put lots of them because they are too little
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_012_comb with some things we can measure with two things with a ruler you can grab it and then you can put some things and then it goes down which thing is heavy or small yeah like like something like some things that you put in the water those things yeah like corks we measure those too
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_076_comb it is because some people when they got it they have their journal they put it the answer we write words what how how heavy or how which one is heavier yeah
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_024_comb yeah the other ball yeah because it it is more the other one is more lighter and the orange and the white is more heavier because it had something inside that it is heavy than the orange
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_018_comb we put the key in the cup in the cup so it does not fall and then we put the wood in another cup and the key is more heavy than the l than the wood
myst_996272_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008_comb and they are small some things are small but heavy and some are big but they are like s like light we been measuring things and we have been measuring like hard stuff and like not easy stuff light stuff
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_086_comb in somewhere like they were right somewhere like they were wrong they were almost no i do not know what those are no we did not no no a chip like a wood chip and that was light then like a
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_074_comb some you have the same but some people like they put like 5s they do 5s are like same as twenty like five and five five and five makes twenty so we the they put like different blocks like of those how many
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_050_comb mi everybody had like one hundred and thirty-one thousand, five hundred and twenty different the paper clips were just like the little blocks like little blocks and we we the l the lit
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_048_comb good every in in in my class they had different people that had little and l like how many they got like thirteen the other one is heavier than the other one if it does not go straight like straight like up to here e it is not like balanced and so we need to put it in the middle
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_130_comb it is it is heavier than the other one yeah yeah we we did how many paper clips to get in the middle and we count them how many did we put
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_132_comb because some have like it is it is big and some are small and it is lighter the other one the the other one is heavier how many the it took to like
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_030_comb if it is in the middle the the thing because we can not start if if it is another way we if it is another way we put something hard like in the back so it goes the s in straight it has different colors like different colors
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020_comb they have they have that little thing like if it goes this way it is like that one is heavier than the other one like
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_090_comb we have to know which measures it like what how if we do not measure and we just guess we have to do it if we if they do not do do not measure it they they will be wrong like it will be wrong
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_128_comb because they are the same but it is it is it is like not balan like the other one is heavier and the other is not because they are the same but in they have something like inside that in that is not the same as that one
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_042_comb we we we saw how many it took to to made it straight like how many it how many pens we count em how many what they took yeah like it is so light like one is middle and one is
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_120_comb and they took us thirteen with the ship and with the red coin w it took us some have middle and some have yeah
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_098_comb the paper clips were just like the little blocks we we but some were like different like how many you measure it with the little blocks and we measure it with the paper clips how many it took
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_066_comb the 20s are big more more s like heavy and the they the those were like little heavy like we and we measured different like a ship like good the little blocks
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_118_comb a little coin like not like a real coin like one of those red coins those
myst_996272_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_104_comb there is like you put ten paper clips but it is still not even like it that wants more hard in the paper clips if you measure the big paper clips it will it will do it 10s but if you measure the little clips it will not do it because one is middle and one is like
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_034_comb yeah not water like a little bit so she can see how how different it is everybody has a different number no we we got this cup like it is a one hundred and you go to a one hundred and you got it like got it like this but we got it all the way at the top so we took a little bit and then we stood it like there
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_043_comb yeah some were the same and some were not the same i do not remember anymore because th these were the same but our te yeah but our teacher put it some more water a little bit so we can have different answers we have been
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_026_comb we wrote the answer and then our teacher could write the answer but it was different everybody because they had the same the same amounts but there was when we got those the cokes we we s we we shook it and then we saw like it had a little bit water so everybody had a different answer
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_018_comb we write the answer what was it in we got the syringe that one and then we d we did it like that so like that
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_059_comb the that one that you take water and then y yeah and then you yeah it it like sometimes it falls a little bit like that yeah i was the only girl
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_067_comb we got this cup and then we put it like that and then we got this syringe and we put it like that and then we put it in the in the coke we did not have the same number like we only had we and a ma and our group we had the re with the other group we had the s same
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_091_comb no some was left there we somewhere it is because some spilled the water like that and then they got all of the water and so and in our group we we had lots of water left m we have been measure water like bottles like yeah
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_020_comb yeah some were different because some were bigger and some were smaller we got the smaller one because not lots of them like those big ones no like the syringe big ones they had like these it but we had the little one there was boys in my group only boys in the girls i was just the only girl in that group
myst_996272_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_093_comb like in the dexte it is like wet the desk because we spilled lots of water
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_014_comb when you roll over it it shows you that they each have their own they each have their own circuit so they each have their own pathway for electricity to flow so so when each of them has the flow they can all absorb the enough amount electricity to make them light really bright
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_008_comb i notice that the flow of electricity going from the bottom of the light bulb goes all the way through the filament and comes out the side of the light bulb so you have to have two wires connecting there so you have a complete circuit i know because there is only one pathway there is only one pathway if there was two pathways for each light bulb they would be brighter because they have more electricity a parallel circuit
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_032_comb the parallel circuit i think the flow goes a little bit different because there is two different pathways
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_022_comb i observe that are two pathways so the electricity can go all the way through it so the flow is that goes a little bit different with the left hand side because it gone up into the bottom and then it goes into the second wire connecting to the left hand light bulb and that create another circuit pathways of flow very well how about you
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_026_comb something i notice is that a the light bulb was off but when it took out and you put a back and it worked i remember that path that now has to be the circuit has to be closed in their camp any open wires of the electricity just in just go out
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_009_comb i notice that the one on the left has a wire that the end in a battery were electricity leaves you just connects to one wire connecting to the bottom i think it will not light as bright because if each circuit has its own pathway there is even more electricity going to the light bulb there are two pathways
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_024_comb the electricity is coming from the right hand light bulb from the side of it and going through the wire and in to the positive side of the d cell because there is twice a much electrici or energy if you have two d cells instead of one we have been learning about the different things that stick to magnet it looks different because you re using two light bulbs
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_005_comb a light bulb does have its own pathway because there is two separate there is two separate circuits going on i notice that there are two batteries are connecting each other but it is only using even my other one which is using to
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_028_comb share with the bot they compare with the bottom circuit because they they each have some light but they also do not compare because there is two path because that light bulbs are on the top were bright something must going on with the direction of flow it is that each there is two different flow systems because there is two different circuits going on
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_013_comb i noticed that there are there are each light bulb has its own pathway but which on the bottom it only has one circuit pathway
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_020_comb pathway is there is censor two different paths for his two different light bulbs so has to two different pathways in order for them the lighter so using the battery that has to be that has to be two wires connected to each sign and it goes through the wire into the light bulb connecting tube
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_011_comb i observed that there are two separate pathways for each electricity pathway to flow through because there is a extra wire on the bottom so electricity flows through that and it creates its own pathway for the left hand light bulb i notice that the electricity come from the side of the second of the right hand light bulb and goes into the positive
myst_007089_2014-04-18_11-02-48_EE_2.2_004_comb well the setup is there is four wires and one d cell and two light bulbs so the wires there you have two wires on each end of the d cell and each of the wires connects to one of the light one side of the light bulbs we have been working with parallel circuit
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_030_comb the impact for the gasoline and then charcoal is a bad impact because it pollutes the air but with the wind turbine in resource well is a good impact because it s a good way to get electricity and you have no energy you have no smoke in the air
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_021_comb the solar system and the wind turbine are different from the gas and charcoal because they don t burn they collect it their stored energy and charcoal and gas away in it yes you can hear noise from the drums
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_028_comb coal and gas are bad for the environment and the solar panel and the wind turbine are because they don t pollute air like gasoline and charcoal when you putting the hands part on the zone it is making sound energy the air around it they comes off smoky
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_006_comb the evidence of energy is that the light that there was a fire and the light is the coal and gas will pollute the air because you have burn them it sounded like a crackling type was sound you can see that is working because the wax is melting so do you can that there is energy because in it the fire and that wax is melting the
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_007_comb a burning candle gives up heat energy
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_017_comb i see all field forces the gasoline burns to make energy the rock burn to make energy the candle burns to make energy and the food when you are eat that it gives you energy coal and gas that have effect on the environment because it would pollute the air and be bad for people to breath
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_005_comb i see that the candle was burning and the wax is melting okay it pollutes the air the air gets on dirty and not good to you for to breathe it the flame is burning i won t be very good because it pollutes the air
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_031_comb when they use a non renewable energy source it burns until burn out you won t have a whole lot because you know burn now and also it pollutes the air we ve been learning and trying to figure out how to create a circuit but lighting two light bulbs ups at the same time
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_025_comb the gasoline and the coal similar because it have burn them to get energy because she is walking and when she would eat she is s getting energy from the food so she can keep on walk energy is important because it makes sense work and without the energy is nothing would work there are similar because they both collect energy storing
myst_007089_2014-03-18_08-14-27_EE_1.4_016_comb i think the girl was eating then its giving that energy so she can keep on walking what they having come on these they both collect energy from the wind and the sun and they will store the energy they so they are both stored energy i do not know
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_013_comb the object that are insulators through the objects that would not metal pieces because they can t carry electricity
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_004_comb i noticed that it had it s the circuit choosing the switch but the switch in close so may have to use a conductor which is right what s the conductor is and this is the nail the conductor which is the nail is going through in its searching the other side of the switch for it took could trouble shoot because you can travel through that kind
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_015_comb the circulator within the circuit what they insulator and is not working because there is not metal metal is the only type of material that will allow electricity of flow i notices that all there are objects there allowing the circuits in electricity of flowing make the motor are flag turn is the metal objects which are the conductor
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_007_comb i ve observed that really the things that conduct electricity or metal any kind of metal usually we ve been learning about solar panel and how would the solar panel on and doing battery energy and stuff i noticed that all the piece will all the pieces that were metal work but the pieces that won t metal didn t work
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_012_comb insulators are different because there was that the thing is like the plastic around the wires that helps the conductors are always metal and electricity can always flow through them
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_011_comb i noticed that the circuit is not working and the flag isn t spinning because the material use trying to be use does a conductor is not metal it is the stick which can t carry which is not a conductor
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_003_comb the electricity is coming through in the battery and its going to through the switch but the switch is a close to make a go through so they have a conductor as nail to connect to the metal piece to go through the wire and into the other wire didn t wire to make motor while upon the keeps doing safe they
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_006_comb i observed happening that those switch isn t worked isn t close for to work so when you put the so it wasn t working but when you put the paper clip in there it s started working because it s a conductor a conductor a material that electricity can flow through to make the circuit work
myst_007089_2014-02-25_13-17-34_EE_1.3_009_comb when they use often metal pieces in the circuit it works they usually like when you use the rock the sponge the rock in the wooden stick and destroy won t work because it s not metal because metal is the only type of conductor usually the circuit doesn t work because it will not carry the electricity
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_018_comb if we add more light bulbs to the series circuit it will do the same exact thing it just keeps circulating round and round because there is only one pathway not
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_019_comb when we add more bulbs you need one more wire
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_007_comb what is important about them is that without one of those the circuit will not be able to work so each one of them has one part to do in this a circuit is a cy is a cycle of electricity that lights up a receiver such as a light bulb
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_005_comb this ma this makes it a circuit because the electricity is circulating and the receiver is lighting up or working this circuit has pathways for electricity to flow through with the wire the electricity is flowing through the battery and through both of the light bulbs
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_006_comb the electricity has to circulate for the bulb to light that tells me that the electricity where it goes is up into the side and through it goes through the filament and then back down into the bottom of the light bulb
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_021_comb if we add one more light bulb in the s once again if we add one more light bulb in the series circuit the light bulbs will be brighter because there is more electricity flowing through them when the bulbs are lit i notice that it is either bo is i notice that both negative sides of the battery are touching each other or both positive sides so it will not work because it will not flow
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_013_comb the moving blue dots connect to my thinking by showing the proof that the electricity is circulating because it is not stopping anywhere because the two positive sides of the battery are touching each other and you need to have the positive side and the negative side need to touch each other not both and positive together or and negative
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_023_comb well when you have one d cell there is not enough energy but if you have two there is enough energy for both the light bulbs and they will light up really bright
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_020_comb if you add more bulbs there is less energy because the bulbs are taking up to the right amount of energy but that is taking more energy from the d cell because it needs because there is more light bulbs so more energy also if you add another d cell to it it will light up more because there is more energy for the
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_002_comb we have been learning about what types of things stick to magnet electricity circulates through the light bulb by going through the side and coming out the bottom of the light i think i m good how about you
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_027_comb i discovered that if you have two positive sides or two negative sides together it will not work because the electricity will not flow but if you have a and a negative side connecting to each other it will work
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_016_comb when i did my mouse i saw that it flows through it in the side and comes right out the bottom of the light bulb and then it will always go round and round and it will never go off the circuit the light with a light bulb will be brighter because there is even more electricity going through them so the more electricity the brighter the bright bulb will be the one with
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_025_comb i see that if you take away the light bulb it will not work but if you put it back it will and also that if you have one battery for two light bulbs it will not light as bright but if you have two batteries for two light bulbs it will light even really bright the blue dots moving represents the electricity and showing you that it is circulating
myst_007089_2014-03-31_13-01-47_EE_2.1_014_comb my observations show the electricity has to flow by going through the right areas by the light bulb lighting up and it is circulating through the right areas and not the wrong ones the electricity in a circuit circulates if the circuit is closed
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_007_comb the wire is what is hook to the battery to make electricity go into the light bulb it s a light bulb a wire and a battery the negative side the wires create the electricity city that powers the light bulb circuits and how to turn light bulb on
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_016_comb that the electricity is traveling through the minus side of the battery going through the wire going and it s going in that the light bulb going over and up and over the filament in it down through the wire and then back into the plus side of the battery
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_026_comb i noticed that both wires are connected to the battery and that one side of the battery is going to the bottom and the other and the one side is that wires is going one side of that wire is going through the bottom of the light bulb and the other would side of the wire is going to decide so that must be in that the electricity is flowing up and into and they when it comes out it goes on the side and comes out
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_022_comb blue dot the blue dots represent the electricity flowing through the circuit it looks like the electricity is flowing towards the positive side of it
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_018_comb it shows me that the electricity going through the light bulb there is the wire is going into the plus side and coming out it going into the positive side and coming up to negative side so may be that means that the yellow part on this part on the battery is positive energy and then the red wire is one the d cell provides the power
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_030_comb i noticed that when y clip it so the side where the little nub is coming out you just flip the battery and that s flow of electricity is going in a different paths because it s going into the negatives the positive side and coming up the negative side because it switch to
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_014_comb that means that that s what receives the electricity it does what s receives the power coming from the battery
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_013_comb that means that is the shh not to source but that is the thing the electric that battery that that s what the battery the electricity as coming from the battery goes through the wire and it goes into the light bulb and it charges the light bulb up and then when they get hot it would have let hot lighter that means that it can light up may else
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_031_comb i noticed that when you connected both wires to the bottom of bulb it didn t light up i don t think it light up because when because both the electricity is because the electricity is coming up the negative side is going into the battery and update but because there is no because bulb wires are connected to the biggest of the bulb the electricity is just going through to and not coming out so can circulate but it s work
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_009_comb and that means that that s the pathway for electricity go through
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_027_comb i noticed that the setup is going good because it s come the both the wires are connected to the battery and then the wire that coming up the negative side is going through straight through the light bulb in that they and then the wire that s going into the positive side is connected to the side of the light bulb
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_012_comb light bulb relating that that the energy goes to and then that when the energy goes into it goes into the filament even it reached up when the filament get heated up it makes a light bulb shine that is the side that is positive energy so the positive energy goes end and then one against to red part it becomes negative energy
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_004_comb the battery is what sending the power into the wire and into the light bulb to make it turn on electricity flows into the d cell towards connect the positive side that means it is the connector
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_029_comb i think if would connected both wires at the base of the bulb the electricity would run through the bulb and then it wouldn t come out the bulb and so it wouldn t lighted up because it has to be circulating if it s not circulating then the electricity can keep going in the light bulb when i want to turn on
myst_007089_2014-02-05_12-35-03_EE_1.1_005_comb that is it holds the energy and then it lets it out and goes into the wire and lets the light bulb work out it tells me that the minus side is the energy there was just been created and when it goes to the plus side it s been created
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004_comb the wire wrapped around the rivet focuses it and that kind of helps it otherwise it kind of would be just it would not be a very strong magnet if it was a magnet at all the reason it got hot was all the electricity was flowing through it and so it got so strong that it started to get hot yeah oth cause we tried that a couple of times and it did not really work out well
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_030_comb the more wire wraps you do the more of the more pieces get picked up thanks for having me switch unconnects unconnects it so the electromagnet cannot so the electricity
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_020_comb you could wrap it a lot more and you could then you can er if you wrap it a lot more then it will focus it more so you will you can make it stronger but if it is barely wrapped then it is just going to be very very very light of it
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013_comb a lots like in a junkyard it will pick up cars with a huge electromagnet and then when it needs to drop them somewhere else then they un they like unconnect a switch like we did on this project and it will undo cannot get through to the electromagnet it will go through
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_025_comb it helped because you realized that the electricity would flow through the wires only from one side and if you had positive pa facing positive it would not work because you have to have a negative facing a positive the wash the na the electricity is getting stronger and it is attracting more and more washers magnet will be stronger
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009_comb maybe electricity carries we did not really talk about this but cause it kind of carry into does it like carry through the wire or does it carry a little bit of magnetism well if it is on a nail object then would it be able to carry magnetism through it that the electricity was was flowing because it got hot
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_031_comb yes i did the electricity is strong because there is a lot of wire wrapped around and all flowing through the pole so quickly that it turns hot no the way we did it is our switch was taking a little bit longer well yeah you could
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_027_comb er unconnect if something is connected and then you take it apart like with legos if the two legos are connected together then and you take it apart it is unconnecting it would not work as well it would be lots and lots less magnetism because if you only wrapped up half of it it is going to go kind of out of it it is not going to be able to be carrying through very well and it is just going to like drop all the magnets it is only going to carry a few
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_050_comb it is important because sometimes you need a battery that is always going i mean a magnet that is always going but sometimes you need to be able to turn a battery off er we make electromagnets by we took the one is not there supposed to be another wire what was the question the electricity comes from the battery
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_048_comb it fits in because it we did this just this morning in science in this picture you have the wires hooked up to the battery and hooked up to the switch and then you have the wire hooked up to the battery and wrapped around the pole and then you have it hooked up to the switch again and the electricity is on the pole
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_044_comb the battery is full of electricity and it makes things run so if you hook a wire up to it the electricity is going to go through the wire and turn on whatever you want to turn on
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_021_comb cause it is focusing it more and it is cause when wires wrapped around a bar it will not really go through but if there is something around it it will be focusing it so that it just stays it will go straight through that path and not have not be able to just get away from it
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_049_comb electromagnets you can turn on and off by a switch and then per permanent magnets you can never turn on and off it is just it is always on the electricity is force is pulling up the washers because it is attracted to them that is the electricity would go on to the met iron pole and then it has electricity in it and it will pick up metal
myst_997287_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015_comb no aluminum would probably not and the electricity flows through the circuit because it comes from the battery and then it comes out through the wires onto the on off switch and then onto the template that the light bulb is zero on and then it travels up into the light bulb and lights it up sorry no it is not in the right spot
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_031_comb well the light bulb is in the light bulb circuit thing and the reason it is not lighting up is because the on and off switch is face is off and not on one wire is connected at the bottom and one wire is connected at the side
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015_comb the on and off switch is important because if you do not have the on and off switch connected the energy is just going to flow off the end or it would just stop but then if it is connected it goes back through the wires and onto the motor which makes the motor run
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_045_comb the circuit is a circle and the energy would flow in a circuit which means the energy would flow constantly in a circle through the light bul
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003_comb so we used a motor and we hooked it up to a circuit board and then we had wires and we had a m a motor and we put the motor in the spot on the circuit board and the battery in the spot for the battery and then we attached the wires through the motor and the on and off switch and then we could turn the light bulb on or off
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005_comb well there was a plastic board that had dents in it where the battery would fit in and the motor would fit in and the on and off switch would fit and then there were other holes that we did not use but we knew where they went because they would fit it would probably light it but since it is not exactly touching touching you might have a harder time to light the bulb
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_009_comb ell you would not use the motor you would take the motor away and then put the light bulb on a light bulb circuit and that could go in the space in between the motor and the l battery and so then you would take the wires and attach it to the light bulbs cer round little place that it would go on and then it would turn on if you had the on and off switch correctly
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011_comb you would attach the wires connected to the motor to the battery and then the battery would make it run in a circle if you would put both wires at the bottom of the bul otor if the motor is running and if the wire is are not connected to the battery it also will not run
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_025_comb because it is facing out and not connected to the wire and when it is connected to the wire the energy flows through into the green wire onto the motor but since it is not s closed it the energy just stops and it can not go anywhere so it can not make the motor run
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_043_comb notice that you can see the wire that is connected to the outside of the bulb and then it connects to the bottom of the bulb and that is how it lights it well in science we have been learning about batteries and magnetism and so we have been testing out how we can use a battery to light light bulbs
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019_comb well if the switch is in the wrong place the motor is not going to run and if it is in the right place the motor will run we attached the wires to the battery and then the other wires to the on and off switch that means that the energy flows through the on and off switch and if you do not have the on and off switch connected it will not flow through eah it flows from the negative side to the positive side
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_041_comb it is lighting the wire that is inside the bulb to make the light bulb light up also in science we have taken a zero what did we do i for
myst_997287_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_049_comb no you can not put the wires anywhere on the bulb you have to put them at the bottom bit where the where the little cylinder thing is or else because that is where the wire is connected so that is how it will light the light bulb
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_100_comb the shavings worked better than the washer and maybe a bigger chunk of steel maybe or something like maybe like sand or
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_084_comb it is telling me that with zero spacers it would get up to nineteen washers and with one spacer it would get up to nine wash nine washers with three space spacers it would get give with four it would get five also and with five spacers it would get three
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_114_comb if the magnets are north and south or south and north they will be attract but if they are north and north or south and south they will repel like if it was cement it would not go through because it was too thick and the ma magnetic field can go through the cement but it could go through a very thin piece of paper or cardboard because it was thinner and it was not as thick
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004_comb today in science we used magnets and we taped em inside a box to make sure that no one could see em and then we used metal supplies to try to find out where the magnets were well since the magnet is attracted to steel they would stand up because it was going into the magnetic field magnetic force is stronger when things are closer and weaker when things are farther away
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_102_comb a paper clip because if it is stayed to that certain spot where the magnet was then you would know where it was yeah the washers when you put them in the weight of the washers is trying to break the force of magnetic attraction between a and the magnet and so the more washers you put in the saint the weaker the force gets
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_108_comb sort of cause opposite sides attract and the same side repel and so if i do not know how to put this if the that the magnet can go through things that i never knew it could go through
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_076_comb up and if you drop in more washers the magnetic field the magnet the washers will pull down harder than the force of the magnets and they will cause it to make the scale move towar towards the bottom by the magnets because a magnet is attracted to metal and steel good how are you
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_092_comb was using the compass it kind of tricked me because it would point to the arrow but there is a lot of metal things in the room and it was really pointing to something metal and it was not pointing to the magnets
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_058_comb well we traded boxes with people and we used metal shavings or a compass and we moved it around the box and then we put it we when we found where we think the magnet might be we drew it on the place where the on the box on the paper the force of attraction was happening
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_046_comb the number of washers would go down because of the weight betw well the force was getting weaker each time so the weight would not have to be as much well if the magnet can attract to the paper clip it will stick to the paper clip sort of and probably maybe about six or seven because it would have to be higher than the three
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_088_comb because it would be less washers but less than the one because there is more washers
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_032_comb yes we did that in another science experiment where we had a w measuring wait no a scale and we put plastic cups in there and then we had a magnet in one cup and a magnet under the cup and we would put plastic chips in between the two magnets and we had washers put in the other cup and we s would see how many washers it took to separate the force of attraction
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_106_comb and when it stays to the paper clip you can feel the force when you are holding the paper clip and then you will know that the magnet is there the things that at that the magnet attracts to have to have iron or steel in them and a plastic chip does not have iron or steel
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_036_comb the two cups the magnet in the cup a it attracted to the magnet under the cup and so the other cup b is just floating in the air because of the magnet in a it is pulling it down and that is what happened when it the metal shavings found the magnet they would stand up no it has to be kind of a thin material like paper or a very thin cardboard
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_048_comb yes i have enjoyed learning about magnets we built a box and we put magnets somewhere where we did not think people would find it
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006_comb well some groups used a compass and they would put it on and then wherever the compass pointed they would use a magnet and try to find out where the other magnets were and then other groups just took the magnets and s put them over the boxes over the box in different areas and then once they found out they would draw on a piece of paper
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_110_comb well a magnet has two different sides north and south and a south and a north side attract or north and a south side attract but a south and a south side repel and a north and a north side repel because they are the same side of the magnet and they will not stick because they are the same but different ones will can stick
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008_comb sometimes you could feel where they are and you would use different materials you could use washers and paper clips and you would f some have a stronger they would attac they would have a stronger force and so then you would know where the magnet is quicker and some forces were weaker and so you did not know where the magnet was as quickly
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_094_comb the compass is attracted to the south or north poles and it is used to magnetic but to it is it is magnetic and it it is when it is how do i put this when there is something by closer than the magnets it will point to that instead of the magnet and that is what was confusing me
myst_997287_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_024_comb no it will not attract the magnet the length of the pendulum affects the number of swings because the longer the pendulum the less swings it makes the shorter the pendulum the more swings it makes the information listed on the x axis is the pendulum length just the pendulum length and nothing else on there so i could use this graph for projecting let us for ten the pendulum could get
myst_996425_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_030_comb the number of swings gets lower and on the y axis is the number of swings that the pendulum made i am guessing it is in fifteen seconds but it may not be think that the twenty centimeter swing would be a tiny bit less than the fifteen centimeter
myst_996425_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_026_comb it the information on it tells me that the shorter the length of the pendulum the more swings it makes you could test my you could test your prediction if you are not sure about it
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_003_comb they are basically paper cups cut to a certain size so that they work almost like boats except they do not have motors on them
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_008_comb yes the one on the far left would hold the most but the one on the far right i think is the same size so i j i just think that the wider it is it would have more support for it
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_013_comb yes you could put bubble wrap around the top and it and a weight on the bottom so then the bubble wrap well on the on the rim of the boat all around the rim of the boat then you could put a weight on the bottom so that it does not tip over then it would probably hold more passengers than just a plain boat
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_009_comb that you had to that you just had to build that you just had to cut paper to make them but they would have to float and carry a lot of passengers
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_007_comb well so the one on the far left would hold the most or would it be the one on the far right except the ones in the middle are skinnier so that they will not hold as much how the pennies were stacked let us say a was stacked really sloppily and d was stacked really nice
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_016_comb you need to spread them evenly you can not just put them in randomly if you put them in randomly your boat will tip over to one side one of the boats could have been really wide and the others and the four and a could have been really skinny they are dev they are designed to save people from a sinking ship that well a big ship that is sinking
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_012_comb how heavy are the passengers let us say you used a quarter instead of a penny that would be way heavy that would be heavier and it would hold less quarters than pennies
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_005_comb it was easy because all you did was you got a dictionary measured up to where you want the height to be then you did it you did not get to choose the size of your cup so i measured up to four centimeters because i thought that would be stable but it would hold a lot and
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_015_comb if they are like tidal waves in it the water it would just sink right when the wave hit it to see how many pennies it could carry without sinking
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_017_comb on the left boat the pennies are added all neatly so they hold so they held twenty-three and it for the one on the right they were they were not spread evenly so they only held fifteen what you would have to do is you would put it in the water then put as many pennies as possible on it do not count the one that makes it sink though
myst_996425_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_021_comb makes me think that you should put pennies in neatly instead of just not doing any neatness in your work when you are doing this learning about variables and making pendulums and boats we had three cups of water and we had to figure out which one was the coldest which one was the warmest and which one was in the middle
myst_996704_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_018_comb we mixed em in a different cup and then we measured how much it was how cold and it was it was pretty good it works pretty well he is trying to figure out which one was the coldest which one was in the middle and which one is the warmest it is very cold
myst_996704_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_008_comb our bodies can sense heat and cold so we are a little bit like a thermometer because we can tell if something is hot and we can tell if something is cold we can tell if something is just right to figure out the temperature of something we have been measuring things and length and then we we went to mass and then now we are doing capacity
myst_996704_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_004_comb one was cold and another one was cold also and the last one was warm c stands for celsius
myst_996704_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016_comb the other cups are fifteen de degrees celsius further than cup b sa and they are twenty so we could not really tell which one was more which was hot more hot becau with our fingers because our fingers were wa we could not decide on which one was warmer and or colder
myst_996704_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_017_comb we had to figure out how cold it was would be and why and we had to estimate how cold it would be if we mixed cold water and warm water together because it has a standard
myst_996704_2011-27-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_013_comb degrees celsius is the standard unit so people will know what you are talk what you are talking about if you say my cup of so my cup of water is f is fifteen degrees celsius you know the higher that the higher the number on the thermometer the hot the more hot it is the lower on the thermometer it is the more cold it is
myst_997278_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_020_comb the magnetic wave is stronger because it does not have as many plastic yellow things in between amount of weight breaks the magnetic wave and we found out that more plastic what are they called we put em in the cup either by dropping them far or we dropped em on the rim of the cup or we just set them in maybe six washers
myst_997278_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_012_comb it showed us the way that magnet work is that the magnetic wave is strong until wait until yes it did yeah we actually did the trick is to put the washers on the on the right side of the cup all stacked up together and then you can get more before the the magnetic wave breaks
myst_997278_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_018_comb plastic yellow round things we could put in between bwe and then we we compared the we compared the differences be like one with zero we had sixteen with one plastic yellow thing in the middle we had seven and then six and then forty-four and four
myst_997278_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006_comb we were we re we repeated to put the metal washers in the plastic cup that did not have the magnet in it and until the magnetic wave broke metal can be magnetized as normally as steel steel or iron i think
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_023_comb the more winds it has the more electricit the more the electromagnet the more powerful the electromagnet is switch turns the electromagnet on and off because it has more electricity in the wires so it can make it the electromagnet stronger
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005_comb electromagnet elec an electric magnet is a magnet but you can turn it on and off and it is normally more powerful than a regular magnet
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_022_comb well the more winds that we have had the more washers that we would get because if we put if we put ten washers i mean i mean ten winds then we would get three wash washers so everytime that you wind it the number of washers that you get keep going up
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_019_comb i would think that if it had two batteries maybe that would make the magnet more powerful steel washers because the the switch is on are attracted to the electromagnet but when it turns off the electromagnet does not work and the steel washers fall
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006_comb zero i see a switch wires a base and a steel rivet and washers and a d cell battery those are the tools that you need to make an electromagnet
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009_comb the switch is what you use to turn the electromagnet on and off if the if the me if the switch if the piece of metal is touching the other piece of metal then the electromagnet will not work if it if it if it does not connect then the electromagnet will be shut off
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_008_comb of that is the electric the electricity flows through the piece of metal which makes it a magnet an electromagnet you could put in a nail maybe a staple anything that can be magnetized that can be picked up by a magnet
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024_comb cause electricity is flowing through the wires so if it goes around the the steel rivet then a one hundred times then it is more likely to have it is it has fifteen washers but if i go down to to ten winds i only get three washers we have been working with magnets and electricity
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_020_comb because if you have two full powered d cell batteries it has two full charged d cell batteries it has more electricity store stored inside them than one
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015_comb the switch is cutting the flow of electricity between the negative end and the positive end of the battery which then cause you can not attach well you could do it one way where you put the wire on the positive end and negative end and you cannot turn it off without pulling the stuff off
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013_comb the electricity is flowing from both ends of the battery there one end is positive end wrapping around the steel rivet which then is attaching to the switch and then the switch is attaching to the negative side of the wire that attaches to the switch and it looks like it is somebody might be holding it about to pickup the steel the washers
myst_997278_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004_comb well today we had we did making electromagnets so it is kind of like two mixed together but other all in the other times we used just electricity or magnetism there is two d cells and the lightbulbs are lighting up more because it has more electricity power
myst_997278_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_006_comb we have been making s the light bulb light or e the last time the last tim we had science we well the d cell we hooked two wires up to the d cell then we put them up to the lightbulb so that the electricity could throw flow through the wires to the lightbulb
myst_997278_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_028_comb well if you flipped one it would not work because and and then the two positives would be on the outside well the two d cells at the bottom are hooked up to each other and then there are attached to two lightbulbs and then there is a wire in the middle
myst_997278_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_029_comb electrical s current would go in a opp in the opposite direction we have made diagrams of what we have done in class yes a little bit i will try to because the electrical current will not be able to get through to them that the electric current have a place to go we made the a motor spin
myst_997278_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_009_comb a little bit but we only had one lightbulb well the d cell battery is f flowing thr is attached to a metal which is attached to a wire which then goes to a lightbulb and the the one lightbulb touches another lightbulb and then it and then the n and then another wire goes into the negative side of the battery
myst_997278_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_027_comb the way that it is going out of is the negative side and it is going into the positive side the important thing is that all the all the bulbs wires and the battery most recently we have been doing electricity and mag magnetism zero the the lightbulbs are lit up more then the previous picture with one d cell the electricity is flowing to the right
myst_997278_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_030_comb mean that the electrical f current would f flow through left no flow to the left because you have twice the amount of power from the d cells
myst_997278_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_010_comb well i see the the electrics the electric flow going through the lightbulb and then h going through the metal the bot the base of the lightbulb and then flowing through into another lightbulb and and a wire touches a negative side of the battery h have to be touching or else the or else the lightbulbs will not light up
myst_997278_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_011_comb it is different because they ha you have two d cells instead of one it will like but they are some are going different way it flips to the other side like there is so worthy and it keeps on here like the blue things move like different ways wires carry like little white pieces
myst_007090_2014-02-04_12-57-18_EE_1.1_005_comb they light they help you get like it is going to a light bulb i knows that they are going just like the same one i am not sure can you say that again well it is the same thing
myst_007090_2014-02-04_12-57-18_EE_1.1_012_comb they they help you like a lot these like going on like a computer needs a wire you is first why and then turns to allow so it turns source is the same thing we have been learning electricity it is like moving so that we can it is firery
myst_007090_2014-03-07_10-51-11_EE_1.4_039_comb i do not know it sounds so that of the energy can move can you repeat that for me it is moving his heat energy it is
myst_007090_2014-03-07_10-51-11_EE_1.4_005_comb it is moving because it fire and it the white stuff is like liquid and sort of fire is very liquid well the flag is moving because the wires helped out to the flag and then the battery gets the battery can get energy it is coming from the battery
myst_007090_2014-02-12_10-59-06_EE_1.2_022_comb well we need to hit the switch when it is out it goes in and the flag starts moving and moving and then if it click it and then go out then it will stop moving i do not know it like it moves like a round in a
myst_007090_2014-02-12_10-59-06_EE_1.2_014_comb well there is a switch battery is a flag and the switch makes the flag move because it is the battery that the energy is coming from its stops the flag
myst_007090_2014-02-12_10-59-06_EE_1.2_027_comb well it is sunny and then the flag is start moving because the great thing it is helped out to the wire and then it help up to the flag i do not know it is starts moving the flag starts it turns light when you close to the sun the flag starts moving
myst_007090_2014-02-12_10-59-06_EE_1.2_021_comb the switch has to click the wire and it will start the fire will start i do not know i do not know it is in closed because the motor is the motor makes the flag move it is getting energy it stops moving
myst_007090_2014-02-12_10-59-06_EE_1.2_019_comb well maybe because the switch hits the wire and the wire goes into i do not know well that crazy is and the flag is going around and it is coming from the battery it has like energy and so it is taking energy from the battery
myst_007090_2014-02-12_10-59-06_EE_1.2_002_comb we have been i am doing like it make like lights gone well kind of cloudy day the flag moves the flag starts moving around an around when the switch hits the wire the flag starts i do not know we have not done it yet we have been doing circuit
myst_007090_2014-02-26_12-24-46_EE_1.3_005_comb i just switch the flag is going around around the switch in the wire the switch is touching the nail and it is touching the wire and the flag is moving that way it is not working the flag is only
myst_007090_2014-02-26_12-24-46_EE_1.3_007_comb in a switch it the flag starts going and when you press the black rock it stops i see the flag moving the flag is going around and around and it is coming from the battery we have been hm
myst_007090_2014-02-24_12-25-51_EE_1.3_013_comb it is useless stick that is not moving you ah other insulated to like it will stop working well the switch is touching the wires so that is making the flag
myst_007090_2014-02-24_12-25-51_EE_1.3_003_comb well the switch is doing it because the switch is not doing it but the cord the wires are doing it because the wires connected to the battery and then may allow is hitting the switch to the wire to make it make to make the yellow button
myst_007090_2014-02-24_12-25-51_EE_1.3_011_comb it is that moving because the stick is not is not a a metal i do not know
myst_007090_2014-04-04_11-01-36_EE_2.1_002_comb we have been learning about magnetism we have been learning magnetism they connect to anything that has iron and
myst_007090_2014-04-04_11-03-32_EE_3.1_003_comb there is one magnet that it straight one is curt and one is a circle because the other nail doesn t have iron in it it sticks to iron well the three magnets are connecting to the refrigerator it sticks because the refrigerator has iron well a trash can it does but a gate does not some of them work and some of them do not
myst_007090_2014-04-04_11-03-32_EE_3.1_008_comb well it has iron and iron is like magnetic iron connects to magnet and so the refrigerator is they are sticky because the refrigerator has the magn the magnet is touching ah the screw well the magnet is not sticking to it because it ah it doesn t have iron in it eh what has iron it sticks to a reflige refrigerator
myst_997408_2010-05-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_011_comb you have to think of how many times you wrap the wire around the nail because if you do not wrap around that much it is no it is not that strong but when you wrap it around a ton it is really strong and pic and can pick up more we have been learning about electromagnets and electricity the electricity is able to flow and it is able to pick up washers very easily
myst_997408_2010-05-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005_comb it is wrapped around nail connected to a switch and a battery to make it an electromagnet so that it can pick up stuff the magnet is what happens when you put electricity wires and a nail together and a switch you are able to make a electromagnet
myst_997408_2010-05-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004_comb that the wire is round around the electromagnet to so to make an electromagnet so that i can pick up the washers you can make an electromagnet insulation means like the copper wire is inside of the green coating yes that is correct
myst_997408_2010-05-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012_comb that you connect it to the battery and the switch and when you want to pick it up you by the switch and when you want a and then when you want to drop it you will not you do not open the switch you by it
myst_997408_2010-05-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006_comb the nail is a regular nail if the wire is not wound around it because when it is round wound around it it allows the electricity to go through and then it brushes up on the n brushes off on the nail so that it is able to pick up washers what do you mean by the rivets does stays ba magnetic
myst_997408_2010-05-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_017_comb the wire allows the electricity to flow through so that it makes the electromagnet that you wrap it around and you turn on a switch they are they are stronger than a regular magnet because there is electricity involved and electricity always makes something more powerful
myst_997408_2010-05-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010_comb when it is open it does not pick up electricity but when it is closed it does pick up electricity yes that is correct well i am not sure well if the switch is connected and the circuit is going it will pick up the washers
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024_comb well the flow of electricity has to be going through the circuit and be somehow getting to a core or something like that and that can pick up the the washers or whatever you want to pick up i am not sure well the wires have to be attached to the core and those will and the magnetic field will pick up the washers
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_019_comb well when you closed the circuit the the core becomes a magnet and you can use that magnet for to pick up things
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006_comb well so you ta you make your circuit and then you take the core and wrap wire around it a bunch and then the core will tr have make a electric field i mean a magnetic field and you can make a magnet the wires are wrapped around it and is picking up the washers
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010_comb when you have electricity wrapped around an iron core it makes a magnetic field which can pick up like washers well the more you wrap around the core the the stronger the electri the magnet will be well the electricity has to be flowing through the circuit or it will not work it has to it and the wires have to be wrapped around and they have to be shut
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_025_comb well the core is magnetic field goes all around it so the magnetic field wants to follow the m washers away well when the switch is open then the it will not work but when it is closed the electricity can flow well if it is an open switch the the electricity can not flow so the the circuit the and the electromagnet will not work
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003_comb well an electromagnet is like so you make a circuit with a core and and the electricity when it goes through it it makes an electric fiel i mean a magnetic field and that means the electricity will be flowing through it
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_011_comb well the wires have to be attached correctly to the the the battery and the switch and the switch has to be on it and it has to be wrapped around a lot of times to get it to pull up a lot of washers
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_005_comb well the more you wrap the more you get pick the more the pi you get that it picks up the core works like a magnet and can pick up things like washers the switch closes the circuit so that the electromagnet works
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009_comb well it go when it goes around the core and it and it is closed it makes an electric fi i mean it makes a magnetic field and that can pick up l things like in this case the washers if the s switch is closed then it will op then they will pick up the magnets well we have been work learning about electromagnets
myst_997676_2011-17-02_00-00-00_ME_4.1_020_comb well when the switch is pushed in the washers like fly up into the air and try to get to the the electromagnet well it is it it does not take as much energy to just power one light bulb than it does two so that one light bulb is going to be more i mean it is going to be brighter
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_027_comb it flows toward well it flows into the plus sign the plus side and goes out the minus side well e well it is always coming in through the plus side into the ba into the battery and then flowing out through the minus side
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_019_comb well the electricity is going around in a circle through the through the wires th in into the light bulbs and then lighting the bulbs so that and then making them get lit and then it keeps going in a circle
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_006_comb well electricity in a circuit is getting moved around through the wires or something like wires to make something happen
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_016_comb well if you have two light bulbs it the battery takes it takes more electricity to for each to power two so it has to spread it out equally and then on the just one it can it does not need to power two so it can just use more electricity on the one battery i mean one light bulb
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_021_comb well i think it has to th flow through a source of electricity and then flow th and then go through some something that will take it and then go through like a bat a light bulb or something that will use the energy a the eletri electricity to do something and then it has to go through another one to make it a series circuit
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_028_comb it it always flows out the minus side and always comes in the plus side i think that is showing that the way the electricity is flowing
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_012_comb i observed that the the one on the right needs has a one more of the light bulb and one more wire and the one on the left has one less wire and one less light bulb than the one on the right
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_007_comb well it has to be it has to flow through the wires from a a source of power and be attached to the light bulb on the bottom and on the side to light the light bulb good how are you it is going in the plus side of the battery and flowing out the minus side of the battery i am not sure
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_003_comb well a circuit is electricity flowing through something that is making something work well it always flows away from the plus side so yeah
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_015_comb well it is not quite as bright when you have two because the battery has to power two and when you only have one it is only working on powering one so it will be brighter on that on the only one so the electricity throws through flows through the pathway to light the light bulb and then flows back into the battery through the pathway to make a circuit
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_029_comb well if you flip it around it will still ca it will switch fri directions and t but it will still come out the minus side and go in the plus side well we have been well today we had four wires and two light bulbs that we had to light so that is what we did today
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_011_comb well just m more wi one more wire and one more light light bulb
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_018_comb well it comes out of the minus side of the battery and comes up flows through one light bulb goes back down through the wire flows into another light bulb and then comes through the other wire back into the bulb and then goes through again and it keeps going
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_014_comb well it is getting lit by the electricity that is coming from the d cell and flowing through the wires that and then getting attached to the battery and lighting it the bat the electricity coming out of the d cell through the wires and into the light bulb it flows out of the negative side the minus side and comes back in the plus side the positive side
myst_997676_2011-07-02_00-00-00_ME_3.1_004_comb i just told you but so you just asked me the same question twice well it always comes in through the plus side and out the negative side well those are steel and iron they will stick to an a magnet and conduct electricity
myst_997676_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_010_comb well insulators are anything that is not metal because electricity can not fra th flow through them so it will not work like plastic will not work wood will not work rocks will not work well all the metal materials will make it spin the motor will not work
myst_997676_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_017_comb well some types of metals stick to magnets but no plastic will well they are all made out of metal or aluminum or some type of metal so that says that m metal will be a conductor but not plastic or wood or things like that
myst_997676_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_016_comb well the metals that attract to the magnets als are pretty good conductors too well well the nail on the right is a steel nail and the one on the left is aluminum and s steel sticks to mag magnets but not aluminum well if you have an insulator the motor is not going to work but if you have a conductor the motor wis run
myst_997676_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_014_comb well when you add an insulator to it it will just stop working well it makes it work better or worse it depends on which what type of conductor it is well insulators are pretty much the opposite of conductors ins insulators are things that prevent circuits from working conductors are things help that help it work
myst_997676_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_003_comb well in this picture you have a bunch of objects on the left that you are going to try and on during in the picture of the motor moving you have a switch a battery and a motor all attached by wires all the things that were metal would make the motor spin but all the things that were not metal would not wor would prevent it from working
myst_997676_2011-27-01_00-00-00_ME_2.3_009_comb well insulators are things like plastic wood and those type of things that will prevent the the elec the circ the circuit from working well well you have to have one of the cords connected to the bottom of the light bulb and one on the side well you have to use it the d cell to get the energy to light the bulb i am not sure i am not sure
myst_997676_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_006_comb it pretty much gives it the electricity so it can spin around through the circuit you connected em to each contact and then that powered it up well a light bulb the light you needed light bulb to pretty much create the light because that is a machine that it used to l l light a little thing and it is and gets the light bulb lit and that will make it bright
myst_997676_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_026_comb they are found on the bottom of the light bulb and on the side of the light bulb well not on the side of the bulb part like on the very bottom and then on the side is the metal part well what happened is you ha you had to attach the battery to the light bulb with the wire so that is how so that is how it worked
myst_997676_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_002_comb well we had a latter a battery a light bulb and two wires and we had to make a l and we were trying to make a light out of it well the circuit is making the bulb light because it will the circ it will because the circuit there is like two parts of the battery part of it will collect the the electricity and part of it will push it out
myst_997676_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_019_comb i am not sure what contact points are well the li the battery is the source is making electricity flow through the pathwa the pathway which are the wires and it is going into the receiver the light bulb and it is making light
myst_997676_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_022_comb because that is where the electricity will come out if you touch like random places on the light bulb that the electricity will not come out there well the electricity has to be running through the wires
myst_997676_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_023_comb well electricity throw flows through the wires because the contact point is letting it out into the wire and then those wires can like touch well does not have to be a light bulb but light is a good example and it will power up the light
myst_997676_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_013_comb well the electricity starts at the light bulb goes in through the wires up to the i mean the bat it starts in the battery goes through the wires into the light bulb and lights the light bulb well they are kind of like things that you can store electricity in so that you can use them to like charge things
myst_997676_2011-20-01_00-00-00_ME_2.1_008_comb well the wires like help it to guide it they go the electricity moves through the wires so it guides it through i think the reason it is says source under it is because that is the source used by a light bulb well that shows that the wires on the other side of the mystery board are connected from a and c
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_009_comb well you have to find the right two brads that the wires attached to or the circuit will not work well that is that is connecting the brads so that it will work
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_019_comb well the circuit you have to attach em to the d cell battery and then you have attach wires to that and then your wi the wire one part of the wire has to be attached to the light bulb and then the li and then a different part of the wire has to be and then the pa the other side of the wire from the battery and the part from the light bulb have to be touching the right brads which is attached to a wire and once those are all connected the circuit will work
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_016_comb well you have to attach the wires to the right brads that is attached on the other side of the mystery board by a wire and that will make the circuit run well gold is a really good conductor so that helps it that helps it work
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_017_comb well the you have to attach them to the brads so that it and then the wire is attached to two brads and you have to find those ones and then that will help it work
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_004_comb well you could try to attach a to b and then you could do a to c and then a to d and then you could do b to a b to c b to d and then you could do c to a c to b c to d then you could do d to a d the b d to c a closed circuit well the wires are attached to the brad on a and the bra and the one on d
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_002_comb well we had this cardboard thing we had these car these two pieces of cardboard that were attached and then we had four brads and there was one that was a b c and d and we had to see which ones had the wire that was under the brads connected to s and that that would start the motor the conductors
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_014_comb well they are made from gold so s and gold is a really good conductor so it will work well well the wire there is the brads and the wire if you attach the wires to of them if you press on two of them the light will the light bulb will light up
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_008_comb well under the ma on the other side of the mystery board you attach it to the brads and then there is a wire that attaches the brads and then that will attach the circuit well well the wire connect keeps the circ it connects the circuit so that it can run
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_011_comb well the the wire is attached to a and c so that is how the so that is and then you have to attach the wires to the the a brad and the c brad so that will work so now the circuit will work
myst_997676_2011-03-02_00-00-00_ME_2.4_012_comb well you have to touch the the brads on it with the part that is not covered up with the insul it is the insulating so that will not so that it is not blocked well the steel nail gets attracted to the magnet because steel and iron stick to magnets although the aluminum nail does not stick because it does not have iron in it
myst_997676_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_014_comb well if you put them on the well magnets d both sides are called poles there is the north pole side and there is the south pole side so the south and the north pole if you have different types or you have the south pole and the north pole together they will stick although if you have like two north say they will like reflect they do not want to come together
myst_997676_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_011_comb well we did a lesson today that we tested magnets on a lot of different things to see if they would stick to it some examples are that rock i was telling you about and a bunch of steel things like paper clips and steel nails hi my name is jonah
myst_997676_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_015_comb well magnets stick to each other on if like if a north and a south pole side come together they will stick although if two norths or two souths come together they will repel off each other and not stick or not they will repel off each other and they will not come together
myst_997676_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_002_comb hi my name is jonah we have been studying magnetism for the past few weeks well magnets get attracted to iron and there is this really cool rock that it gets gets attracted to it is called magnetite i i think i am not quite sure well if you had a north po pole then it would go then it would attract the south pole if you had a south pole it would attract the north pole
myst_997676_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_017_comb well the ones that are north and south the ones that are opposite come together the ones that are not opposite like the the one that is north and north they will repel off each other and the ones that are south and south repel off each other but the ones that are south and north do not repel well we have been learning about magnetism in science and how magnets work
myst_997676_2010-13-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_012_comb well magnets stick to anything that has well almost anything that has magnets if i mean that has iron if you have enough of it well we are seeing how much the spacers would break the magnetic force by seeing putting spacers in between the two magnets and then trying putting washers in it so that is what i think is happening
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011_comb it basically just s it makes it so that the magnetic force is not ex is not as strong and it will not keep that force there because the magnets i mean they will not stick together if they are as far away or they will not stick as hard
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006_comb if you have to add more washers i think that means that the magnets are stronger in or in other words the magnetic force will be stronger well you are putting spacers in between the two magnets so it is starting to break the force the magnetic force slowly weakens until it is not magneti until it does not stick together anymore
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_019_comb well group c put them in not very carefully and they all just like were crunching around and they were dropping em from higher up so that might have made it worse and break the force just because of gravity
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004_comb well we figured out that the amount if you have two of the magnets they they ba they balance each other so we tried to we put different washers in the b cup t to and see how many we could put with put on there before it broke the force that kept it level
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_014_comb well the magnetic force is coming from the north pole magnetic north and magnetic south and they attract each other and they attract together group a group b group d they all got pretty much the same answer except group c just kind of threw their washers in in bad order
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005_comb well if the b cup if it is too heavy in the b cup because there is so many washers in it then it will break the force of the magnets
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_003_comb well we did this experiment where you had these where you had this scale and you had two magnets and then you had cups so you would put the cup on the scale and then stick one magnet on the top of the on one side of the scale and then you would have another magnet and you would put it on the other side of that same part of the scale
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_010_comb well what we learned is that the more spacers you put in the less mag i mean the less washers you could put in without the magnetic force breaking well the magnetic force force is decreasing because it is getting pushed away from each other and the poles can not push together they are getting spread apart well it means magnetic force is pretty strong
myst_997676_2011-10-01_00-00-00_ME_1.3_013_comb the distance increases well you would want to use like the same wa the same like type of washer and then you would want to place em very carefully in the same order not all like not drop em from too high so that it is not just like the force of it falling that breaks the magnetic force well you need to make two spaces actually i am not sure
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_007_comb well to make it stronger you should wrap it around the core more times or you should put more batteries in well on the bottom it shows the er wire wraps so the farther you go to the right that is the more wraps you do and on the left that is not that is more er that is the more washers you do well one way to strengthen it is to wrap the winds around a lot more times
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_020_comb the number of washers just inc keep increasing the more washers you er i mean the more winds you put it is making the magnetic field bigger well the more wire wraps you get the more washers washers you will pick up
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_027_comb well the one on the bottom represents where it says wire wraps that represents on the bottom that is how many wire wraps there are the numbers on there and the washers means the higher it goes up the more washers it is picking up h it has to be flowing through the circuit and has to be wrapped around a core i am not sure it means it is stronger
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_003_comb well the power from the er circuit er turns in er there is a electromagnet field around it and you can use that and you can put it like around a core to make a magnet the well the more winds you do the more washers you washers you will pick up and the less winds you do the less washers you will pick up er you can wrap it around more times
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_002_comb well an electromagnet is it is pretty much a magnet cause el elec some elec electricity has magnetic fields so electromagnet is using the er magnetic field from a el el from like a electric circuit to and use that as a magnet the more winds you have the more washers it will pick up
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_031_comb well when the number of wraps get larger the the data the wash the number of washers goes up some of them drop because it will not pick up as many iron or steel well it is showing that like the more er wraps you do the er more washers it will pick up well the more wraps you do around the core the more washers you will pick up
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_030_comb the farther you go to the right it it increases ten wraps and it is getting higher well the more washers you pick up that means that is the stronger it is and the when its not as strong you will not pick up as many washers well er the more wire wraps you do it is showing the more er washers a closed circuit
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_029_comb well the more er wraps that you do the er higher the graph get because that is how where the washers are well the strength of the electricity that makes the magnetic field the stronger it is the more washers it picks up well the the more winds you do the stronger the magnet is and the more it will pick up
myst_997676_2011-24-02_00-00-00_ME_4.2_012_comb if you un if it is not as wrapped around as many times a light bulb well part of it shows that where the battery is part of it shows where the swi part of it shows where the wires are that are connected to the light bulb which lights that up or is that a motor i can not quite underst
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_021_comb the motor is receiving electricity and that is making the flag spin around there is a motor at the bottom it is making the flag spin around it represents a light bulb that is getting lit the circuit it gets cut off and it then it starts up up again
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_010_comb the wires carry the electricity from the d cell well the d cell is sending power through the wires which are touching the the contact points on the motor which is making the motor spin and making the flag spin
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003_comb well you attached the mo you attached the the wait well a motor once you use the battery and the wires to put attach them to the the motor the motor will spin zero i am not sure
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015_comb well the motor is running so it is spinning the top part which is attached to the flag so the flag is spinning around well the battery gives the gives it the power to and the electricity to make the motor spin and the light bulb light
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_031_comb well there is a switch in it now so if you push the switch down it will turn on and if you take it off it will not aa it will not make the motor work well when it is closed the electricity can get to the motor and the circuit is working but when it is open the electricity can not get to the motor and the circuit is broken light bulb that is getting attached to the contact point so it is getting lit
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_012_comb well a receiver means that you receive the electricity and do something with it like in like the motor makes the makes the flag spin well all the wires have to be connected to the right spots and the battery has to still have electricity in it and the motor has to be not working
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019_comb we well the electricity is getting used is getting is spinning around and getting used to do something in this case it is making the flag spin on the motor well the wires take take the electricity and you can connect them to something so that it can make a circuit i am not sure
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005_comb well a cell or a battery makes it has it has electricity and if you attach wires to it it will let the electricity out and you can use that electricity to power something up well well when the switch is closed when it is touching the wire it makes the motor spin and when it is not the motor is not spinning
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013_comb because the switch is not touching there so it needs to be touching before the switch will work well today we did this this thing where you you had a battery a wire and a motor well a d cell gives the gives the electricity for the circuit
myst_997676_2011-24-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_032_comb that is a switch well the battery is being attached to the motor and it is also being attached to the switch which will power the motor well the parallel circuit has two pathways to go through and the series circuit only has one
myst_997676_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_014_comb well electricity throws flows into the positive side of the battery and out the negative side of the battery
myst_997676_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_020_comb well the two closed parallel lines in the middle that means a battery and the circles with the swirl on it that means the that is the light bulb and the straight lines are the wires that there is more than one in a parallel circuit there is more than one pa
myst_997676_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_007_comb well on the series circuit is all hooked up togethe everything is all hooked up together in the parallel one it is kinda like two circuits just powered by one thing i am not sure well we have been working with parallel circuits and series circuits we are working with electricity it is a way of showing a parallel circuit
myst_997676_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_019_comb well in the very middle of the parallel lines that is the battery and then and then the and then the ends of the battery touch the very top which is a wire up there and then another wire that is attached in each ba and each wires are attached to the the light bulb and then the other wire takes it back in the battery well that is a parallel circuit
myst_997676_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_013_comb well th electricity always throw flows through the nega out the negative side of the battery and back in the n positive side of the battery each wa each light bulb has its own pathway and yeah well each light bulb has its own pathway from the battery
myst_997676_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_010_comb yeah each component has their own pathway and they are both connected to the same side or they are both connected exactly the same a parallel circuit means the circuit are exa the circuits are exactly the same and they are not connected together they have their own different pathways well the bulb in the series circuit are dimmer than the ones in the parallel circuit
myst_997676_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_012_comb well since they since the one on the the parallel circuit has its both of its own pathways it it only has to each pathway only powers one light bulb rather than the series circuit which powers two this represents a parallel circuit we have been making s this circuit it is one battery and it is powering two light bulbs at once
myst_997676_2011-10-02_00-00-00_ME_3.2_005_comb well a parallel circuit is a circuit with two well it can be two but an equal number of well things like a light bulb or a motor something that a certain number of battery is powering and they are both attached to things the same way so yeah i am not sure
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_003_comb well there is a magnet somewhere in the box and you have to find it
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_002_comb well last time what we tried in science well we had this box just like a cardboard box and you would tape a magnet somewhere in the box and then you would give it to a different group and they would try to find the magnet and they had four materials they had a different magnet they had a compass they had like little scraps of iron and
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_019_comb well what attracts the magnet i think is iron cobalt and nickel those are the three big ones but in in steel so the paper clip is made out of steel which has iron in it so
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_018_comb well well the paper clip is works really well because it will because the paper clip is has iron in it so it a gets attracted by the magnet so it gets pulled to it
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_015_comb well the paper clip was like sticking to it was like moving around it was just coming to it like when i dropped it down it would fly over to the magnet well the paper clip is like spinning around as you well when you are moving it it is like forming different directions it is like moving around and d like spinning in different directions so that means the magnetic field is making it move that way
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_011_comb well the magnet is getting attracted well the paper clip is getting attracted to where the magnet is because it is magnetic material so it will come to it well the magnetic force is pulling them towards it and then they are standing up because of the magnetic field the way it is going
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_021_comb well that just shows that the magnet is magnetic well that the compass is magnetic seeing that it will always spin around and it will also show that opposites attract there the paper clip flies to where the magnet is because the magnetic field is pushin is pulling it in
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_005_comb the i am the magnet was be was in the upper left corner because the iron like the iron shavings were like forming the magnet shape where the magnet was
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_016_comb well iron is attracted to the well th the iron in the magnet makes it attracted to the the the iron in the other materials
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_017_comb it it starts like flying towards where the magnet is cause it is like just above the left corner the left lower corner so it flies up there and saint wants to stick to the magnet i see where the magnet is it is in the lower left corner
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_010_comb well what the case is with the paper clip and the iron filings is that iron at is attract a iron magnets attract iron so iron sticks to magnets it also sticks to cobalt and nickel although the one we are using is iron you do not know where the magnet is in it there is probably a magnet in it
myst_997676_2011-13-01_00-00-00_ME_1.4_022_comb well when you get by to the magnet it will start pointing real hard then when you move it around it it will start spinning at it so that is how you know that that is where the magnet the paper clip is like spinning around as you do it because that is the way the magnetic force is moving well the magnetism magnetism is like what the filings are getting pulled to
myst_996271_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_012_comb yeah we were looking for for the volume as i told you but what was the other thing i think so s then we poured it in into the into the soda can
myst_996271_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_052_comb huh so we we we we first got a bunch of water then we sucked it up from the big container that we had then we pou then we poured it in then then we left it there then we filled it up again and then we poured it in and we kept doing that until we got our answer
myst_996271_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_006_comb graduated cylinder and something that soaks up water it is called a syringe yeah syringe we used it so no we put em in the soda can and then we measured it i do not really know we did a talk about that i do not think so capacity the volume because it is not all the way filled to the top
myst_996271_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_014_comb yeah capacity the capacity is when i know what capacity means it is when it is not filled all the way up but
myst_996271_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_112_comb since it tells us how much something is of water or soda something and instead of using the vials it well it tells you to but a vials that does not tell you how much it is it does not tell you at all anything
myst_996271_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_072_comb well we had our syringe again then then what is it called it was all the way to the top and pretty much yeah it was all the way to the top well a liter is bigger than a milliliter well let us see a milliliter is
myst_996271_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_090_comb we used grams we have been been talking about the value the va the value the volume is when something is filled up all the way to the top and yesterday we we f we we did the volume of a soda can
myst_996271_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.1_108_comb no because you do not know how much water you put in there well soda cans are not filled all the way to the top so when we were done we checked on the bottom of the soda can and it l and and we checked how many millimeters it it holded and it holded three hundred and thirty-five thousand, three hundred and thirty-five
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_054_comb we measure zero i remember now we measured it with with paper clips so so we could it was important becau because it could because let us see so it could it was important because let us see
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_016_comb we had we had to make sure it was balanced right so we put two cups in the side we set it up and then we got to balance things like like wood chips chipped and washers and other stuff zero a gram is heavier
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010_comb it is called a balance and it and it weighs things like how much it w like it can weight about let us see it can weigh like let us see like yeah we did it with paper clips i remember okay
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_096_comb zero yeah when we measured the wood chips with grams some people got different answers yeah i it has to be zero yeah
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_074_comb we had to use another object object and we used grams and there was twenty grams ten grams five grams and one gram and we had to first measure the the washers yeah the washer and it was about
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_070_comb yeah our table groups got i th yeah twelve and another one got one and another one got i think it was ten and another one got i think it was about wa two yeah two
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_018_comb because we had what is it called a white thing on the back on the back over there and we had to move it around so this so the the little thing has to co it has to be balanced with that and we have to move it around so it could be balanced
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_038_comb we we had to sort them in the cup and we we measured all of em and then we had to sort them and our teacher gave us the grams like like squares that were grams and we had to measure how much grams they were because everybody had the same kind of grams
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_072_comb it was it was not such a good idea because some were big and some were small
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_098_comb we do not we did not really figure it because some people got like like the some people got bigger bigger wood chips and some people got smaller wood chips so one of the tables got like they got about fifteen grams of the wood chip
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_116_comb we did em with centimeters we did em how big our se we did em how well wh what part of our well what part of our what is one part of what is one part of our body that is one centimeter yeah it is it is important to always have the same kind of objects same size
myst_996271_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_060_comb why do we do it why water bottles what else what else like we had to we had to balance it because there was like this little thing i do not know what i do not remember what it is called but what it called
myst_996271_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_050_comb yeah well we kinda did the same thing we first put one water bottle on one side and then the other and we figured out that one side was on the lower and the other one was higher and the one that was lower weighed the most it weighs more it is something that weighs that weighs like
myst_996271_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_026_comb we worked with chips we worked with washers we worked with lots of things with water bottles and we measured how much it weighed because it is it is it is straight and the fulcrum is is in the middle it
myst_996271_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_090_comb we figured out that we needed ten ba ten sets of a one hundred to make a kilogram because a kilogram is a one thousand grams
myst_996271_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_036_comb it it was kind of it was it is that thing right there yeah fulcrum yeah the fulcrum we had to yeah we had to balance it with we had to balance it so it could be equal that some that some were smaller and some were bigger so s so some people got different answers
myst_996271_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_028_comb so we had a balanced so we had a balance balance and and and w so we had t we it had to let us see yeah because it was not equal
myst_996271_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_008_comb with we have to figure out with i do not really remember but it was a stan and it does but i was like the biggest and some people got like two with the big ones they were bigger
myst_996271_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_102_comb that is a kilogram actually that is about a one hundred grams water bottles so it is m the same like weighs more than one thing or less equal they have to be the same size
myst_996271_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_088_comb because you could see how many because you can see how many because of when you pulled it pulled it all to the top it would tell us a number and then it and then it would different because your hand is smaller than a ruler or something like that
myst_996271_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_110_comb that one because it is well i do not think that one is supposed to move water because it is taller and it is and it is not as wide and we weighed how m and we tried to figure out how much how much millili milliliters it has what is it again it is it is
myst_996271_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_028_comb because if you look in inches off a ruler you would get better results because you cause your hand could be about six inches and the ruler is about twelve in twelve inches and you can measure better well we used it so it could help us get our answers right
myst_996271_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_096_comb well you first pull this up and the until it gets to the bottom until it gets filled all the way up and then you see and then at the number did you see how much it holds and those are called what are those called what are those called i think milliliters
myst_996271_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_104_comb we did but but is but when i pour it all the way out we have to see we have to count how many how many water it had left i do not think so because if you use like
myst_996271_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_122_comb they could be any size and they can be and if you pour the same it could be filled up it could be it could be filled filled up that that that they w that when you open a soda can it is not filled all the way to the top
myst_996271_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_086_comb it is like it is like something that sucks up water or something i do not think to because a meter is longer than your hand zero what is it i li i l i like looking at the millimeters zero i want to do the more advanced i want to do the more advanced meter stick i want to do the more advanced meter stick what happens when i click there zero yeah zero yeah
myst_996271_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_115_comb measuring long distances like the school to the house no actually what happened we measured from our room all the way to the office i know but this but but my arm span was was was actually longer than how tall i was and it was more than a meter then we measured the room and with some medium sized pace what is investigation two when w you are moving to a new house although i have never done that
myst_996271_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_081_comb that that the straws are not good no i want to look at the i do not know but i se i forgot what i wrote about that ten and there is ten decimeters and one zero yeah one okay so what else is is there
myst_996271_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_087_comb yeah but the small but the others wanted to go back up to s one then but the group straws they go keeps ch and where it says group straws the the group a straws were a lot longer than group b maybe i would use millimeters to be i actually live in louisville
myst_996271_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_133_comb the we did that one i wanted to meter chalkboard we have not done that one yet yeah i want to videotape my tonsils again i want to see the other meter stick he is measuring his height not not not usually some of em we do not know we all measured with the same medium sized pace three thousand, three hundred and fifty-four yes four meters
myst_996271_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_103_comb one centimeter i always get mixed up no but we had a piece of paper which was a medium sized pace what happens when i click on scale yeah but i want to go to more stuff on a s and i want the we measured each other with meters and saint s
myst_996271_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_017_comb yeah it started with the smallest and it went to the highest n it worked the bulbs are lit and the bottom is touching the metal onto the plate they are two lights and one battery they are lit too
myst_997282_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_067_comb i think there is it is about light bulbs and batteries well the na the electricity always comes out from the and then comes back into the positive i am not quite sure but i think it is batteries and two motors
myst_997282_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_011_comb the wires have to be in and the plate the red plates have to be there for the light to touch i noticed they are all connected and touching well and since there is two batteries the light is much brighter the electricity goes from the and it goes through the light bulb then comes down into the other one and comes back to the battery
myst_997282_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_017_comb one has to be on the negative side and the other has to be on the and then the other ends of the wires have to be in the little loops so it connects to the light i have been doing things with electricity and a battery if they are not at least touching the bottom part the electricity can not get to the light bulb
myst_997282_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_069_comb in class we have a paper that has these symbols and it the wrong disk the circles with in cursive e in it are light the lights and the lines are solid are the wire and the longer line and the shorter one is the battery
myst_997282_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_029_comb the lights s screw into the little a little hole so then it touches the bottom the black part touches the bottom so when the wires are in it the the electricity goes to the bottom and up the all of the wires are at least hooked up to the little plate the f it the energy flows the other way
myst_997282_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_013_comb the wires have to be in so then the electricity can flow in the light the other direction like the electricity goes to the right and to the other side the energy switched because the negative is now on the left side they help hold it because or else you have to hold the light while you put the wires on
myst_997282_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_003_comb we have a light and wires and we put the battery in this slot and then hook the wires to it and then hook the wires to the light too because with two batteries there was more power they are not they are not as bright as the other ones they are less light if they are not hooked up the electricity can not go from the from the battery and it can not get to the light
myst_997282_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_007_comb we just had these little slots that are like loops and once we put em in and there is a plate that goes with the light so then it has to touch the bottom slide thing on the battery it has to be on the sides for the and and the other side of the wire has to connect to somewhere on the light bulb
myst_997282_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_029_comb well the energy from the negative comes it f goes out from the and then it will like come back f into the positive so then the energy goes all like in a circle i see the light bulb the wires and the battery a circuit is like when energy goes around and comes back
myst_997282_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_061_comb e the drawings relate because everything comes back to where it started but it goes away for like a square and it comes back i am not quite sure cause we did not really do that we put it under because the it has to go through like this little thing inside of it it is it stops the motor and the connection
myst_997282_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_021_comb we also made a light bulb work it is like the first thing but we had this play and a small light bulb instead of a a motor i think it is like the motor and then the switch and the battery it always comes out of the negative i am not exactly quite sure
myst_997282_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_051_comb what the battery was and the light bulb and all and like the wire things we so we had a switch with it too so we had another wire and put another on so then eh if we put this a metal thing under it it will stop and yeah
myst_997282_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015_comb the wires are connected to it so then i think the metal ha puts pressure on it so i think it stops the energy f went the other way i do not think i saw it bu the switch is so it turns on and turns offttu
myst_997282_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019_comb the energy from the the d cell battery it flows through the wire there is these two little slots and you put the wire on it and the red wire and then you have this metal turny thingie that you put under
myst_997282_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_049_comb we had these little symbols and we saw in a key and just saw where the things were we have like a motor and that it connects to wires so we put it on a battery and put the wi the wires onto the and positive so that it will start spinning
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_083_comb the difference is they are not as heavy and they are not as strong no it did not it just kind of moved around wherever the magnet was under the plate when it there is there is there is north south west and east and then there is a little pointer so that you put it in the direction and then it will s spin around and point out the area
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_017_comb i s ma magnets are important for like for like things that use electricity i think well when we used it the compass kind of pointed out where it was in the box so then we searched that area
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_089_comb i see the two different kinds of metals or magnets are sticking together cause one is weak and the other is not we were trying to find them cause other groups hid em somewhere in the cardboard box and we tried to find it well it kind of looked like it stuck up and it followed the magnet wherever it was the pointing tells where the metal is and like yeah
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_073_comb the me the magnet is sticking to the magnet with the lead inside the pencil i am not really sure to f e so then it can find the other magnet the iron stuck to the magnet cause the magnet has this thing in it that like makes it go up it so it follows it but it can not exactly stick to it cause there is a plate
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_099_comb i think the magnet will pick up the rock the paper clip the nails and i think it is like a washer but i am not sure because the others are not made of metal and it looks like the kind of metal would stick to ma a magnet well it does not exactly find metal it just points out where it is
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_097_comb i think that they look like the same kind but the power is really weak so then it will not like and the other is not so then it the force does not work we like w we did not know where they were so we used magnets like i mean metal and a compass to find it cause they hid it somewhere in the box
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005_comb and we put magnets in a box and tape it then use different kinds of metals to find it the power with two magnets going together ma releases more power so then when another magnet comes it f it sits on top of it yeah with my other people in my group we have been doing things with magnets
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_057_comb well we had a paper plate and then our teacher put some of it on and we had a magnet and put it under and see h saw how it moved around and reacted there are two different kind of magnets and some are s i am not sure but i think some are stronger than the other there is copper
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_045_comb by using like a nail or another magnet and then like put it on the box and find it til it s feels there are different kinds of metals and they only stick to certain kinds i am not quite sure iron and not steel and i am not and like like stuff
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_103_comb the rock i think and the yeah so what is the question the magnet is sticking into the is like sticking to the pencil but it is because there is lead inside the pencil that is what we used to write and the magnet attracts to the lead
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_027_comb there is metal or a magnet inside the compass so then if the me a metal or like a s rock somewhere it points it out the others are the same kind so they could but i am not the power is i think different so then they will not come together cause they are the same material
myst_997282_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_075_comb the magnet is strong on one side and the other so it is like the magnet power is making it flow on top of the other magnets well it only sticks onto like a special kind of metal and yeah
myst_997282_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_018_comb i think that when the power goes into the metal it it just does something to get the washers to go up we use just normal magnets
myst_997282_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003_comb well first we had a rivet and a short wire and a long wire we also had a battery and we first con tried to connect all of them together and we had to wrap around the wire like forty or thirty times to the rivet we also had to connect the wires to the switch that is how it can turn off and on so then it does not flow back to the battery
myst_997282_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013_comb the rivet is a magnet kind of so then it picks up the washers well i am not so quite sure but i think it is a special metal but i am not quite sure
myst_997282_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_004_comb we had a switch and little washers too and we just put them in special places and wrapped it around and connected all of them together to try to make it work and pick up the washers the electricity always comes out the negative side and comes back in the positive side so it goes like in a circle back to where it started what did you say
myst_997282_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015_comb no they will not when the switch is closed the mag the little rivet picks up the washers we tried that and nothing would happen because there is no power going into it i do not think so but i am not sure if i am correct it is just in my opinion there is not enough electricity going to the rivets so then it can not pick up the washers
myst_997282_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_024_comb well if er the circle does not all connect it will not flow and if the switch is not connecting it will not flow the rivet is picking up the little washers the washers got they stuck to the rivet we asked for help from mister marcini and he told us try wrapping it around the rivet
myst_997282_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_006_comb they picked up the little washers from the little rivet and we had to have a lot of power so we wrapped it a lot we we just tried the wire touching instead of wrapping it around and nothing happened we made a magnet that can s turn off and on
myst_013066_2014-04-30_12-25-19_LS_1.3_011_comb a plant makes it is own energy with sunlight and dirt you only eat plants and herb animals eat other animals and plants to get their energy they turns into dirt
myst_013066_2014-04-30_12-25-19_LS_1.3_017_comb it gets the energy from well the dead plants and animals and they decompose they eat both plants and meats so all of the foods
myst_013066_2014-04-30_12-25-19_LS_1.3_042_comb it makes it so it the plants get their nutrients and then the herbivores can eat the plants and the food they produce the energy so they are we have been learning about they turn the leaves and stuff
myst_013066_2014-04-30_12-25-19_LS_1.3_006_comb each animal has a place in the ecosystem and they are they can the energy to get it the producers produce the food for for the
myst_013066_2014-04-30_12-25-19_LS_1.3_018_comb they get rid of the dead stuff and turn it into soil nutrients for the plants to grow and the cycle starts all over again
myst_013066_2014-04-30_12-25-19_LS_1.3_022_comb they are deer moose and bunnies which eat plants lions and polar bears which eat only meat omnivores humans and bears which eat meat and like fruit and earth worms and fungi which are detrivores that eat decaying it is the biosphere
myst_013066_2014-04-30_12-25-19_LS_1.3_016_comb a decomposer well decomposes like dead plants and animals and turns them into soil like some decomposers are bacteria bacteria fungi or being a producer means you produce the energy yourself
myst_013066_2014-04-30_12-25-19_LS_1.3_013_comb it means that you eat others things to get cleaning off things that come from the sun on an animal and the mushrooms get the from the suns energy goes to the mushrooms wee decomposers eat raw things on land
myst_018219_2014-10-08_11-58-16_LS_1.3_002_comb i do not know omnivores only eat berries and and meat
myst_018219_2014-10-08_11-58-16_LS_1.3_017_comb they are important in a food web because they all eat each other like the shark eats the bird or the bear eats the bird or the bear eats the monkey the the or whatever it is eats the fish and the hawk eats the bunny
myst_018219_2014-10-08_11-58-16_LS_1.3_048_comb that they like that environment by setting off the computer i do not know i do not know deer eats the rabbit and the rabbit eats the grass a carnivore eats meat it creates all the that has things in the world cause cause it gets the energy from the sun
myst_018219_2014-10-08_11-58-16_LS_1.3_011_comb because of the the carbon dioxide that goes into them and the sun duh getting all the food from the thing that eats the plant to get the suns energy and whatnot they will dig holes in it and eat the food inside the dirt

myst_018219_2014-10-08_11-58-16_LS_1.3_032_comb i already told you meat i do not know is all about things that grow on the ground and bacteria you get it we have not been doing this of the human body cells and the animal cells we have been learning about about the human body and all of it the parts of it we have been learning about the human body and all the living cells inside of it these are all the yeast cell
myst_018219_2014-11-04_09-53-35_LS_2.3_001_comb good how are you they are made of flesh and that the skin cells connect to i see some sort of design but i can tell what it is i see some sort of weird little cell and in the plant cell that is more different than the human cells
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_020_comb brain cells on the animals make them smarter the skin cells are all over the animal is body like ours and with the brain cells like ours and the leg they have the same cells as the muscle cells us to keep us standing up
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_021_comb i noticed a bunch of little cells in the yeast and in the skin cells we have been studying the how wheat if it can grow in the dark or it can better in the dark or grow better in the light and right now we are learning about butterflies
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_023_comb what is up with the two types of cells is they each have different patterns the yeast cells all connect in a different way than the human cells the human digestive system goes with food because if you did not have a digestive system your food would not be breaking down that good and going into your blood stream
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_031_comb it shows us the different parts on the butterfly and the human like there is like a little green things little green lines coming out where the it shows us and the human has a little dotted line to where one little thing is all the other little cells inside it
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_030_comb it has to do with what we have been talking about because a butterfly has a whole bunch of different cells like humans yeast plants and other living organisms organisms i mean what main points muscle cells are the most part of the body so that you could run or walk or even stand up i do not know
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_019_comb yes because of the animals the mammoth mammals all have the same skin cells that they hold the skin together with the flesh when i click on the leg i noticed a whole bunch of little bugs inside of all of the plants in the ground like the roots what it tells me about humans and cells is all the things that they do
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_028_comb that there is a blank screen in front of me all of the other parts of the digestive system on a human we learned that the mouth breaks down the food with this water liquid called saliva so that it would help the food break down as you are chewing it
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_029_comb i think the human has the most cells cause it is like a big part of a body instead of like one little thing like the yeast only has one cell but the leaf has a lot of cells but not more than the human it breaks down food
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_007_comb i notice human body with the wrist highlighted the head the brain highlighted and the thigh highlighted i see the brains neurons connecting to each other to make the person smarter i think this can be trying to show all of the different part of cells that all different kinds of things have
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_041_comb the esophagus or the esophagus slides down to your your food so and starts breaking it down a lot more and then goes to your stomach all the living cells and other plants
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_038_comb the mouth chews down all of your food all of your food so you you will it will break down in saliva which is a water liquid will help it break the stomach has this liquid acid that will rise up and the food comes down and it will melt the food down
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_015_comb important to these is a kind of skin cells is how what we have been learning about healthy hearts they are the biggest part of the digestive system the large intestines is for the waste removal and the small intestines is for the food to go down digestive systems help your food break down and go into your blood it looks like whole bunch of worms connecting together
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_033_comb the human is digestive system is bigger than the butterfly is digestive system cause butterflies are smaller than other mammals like the human for example has a bigger digestive system from all of the the stomach the and the all the they both have cells
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_005_comb a living cell what it has to do with what we have been learning is the mouth is the most important so cause if you did not have a mouth how would you chew your food and go down the esophagus to like so it would not hurt your throat this could be trying to show me the different types of cells each animal had
myst_018219_2014-10-15_14-39-35_LS_2.3_026_comb how it compares to the human cells is the human cells have more than the leaves and one leaf cause the human is just one big part of everything that they have little tiny strings coming out of them called neumrons and every time you learn something new a new neumron comes out they each have different patterns on them all of the veins the lungs and the heart
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_016_comb it has the earth it has a whole bunch of systems little subsystems because the wheels and the axle are both part of the system to make the car roll i think that they have the things that they need like a sparrow it is a secondary consumer and there is also only consumers
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_018_comb earth is a system because it all the little subsystems that help the cars trains and other things run and move the different colors on the map represent a whole kinds of different things it has to do because of all the little subsystems in this body they are part of nature and humans it shows all the parts to

myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_019_comb all the parts that have to do with each other you they connect to make the earth move and spin around and help all the air the and the carbon dioxide the carbon dioxide will go away and new air will pop out of the trees and it helps us to breathe
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_024_comb i think the biosphere is made up of all the land the water and trees and no houses around i see a mountain trees houses and an ocean all the parts of the earth on a car they are both part of the earths ecosystem
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_023_comb i think the biosphere is all about the animals where the animals live like the water and where the birds live is the trees
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_015_comb they work by the heart it helps you breathe and in the veins they help you like memorize and the lungs and the digestive system help you not too like get to full or something
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_034_comb the food web means to me a bunch of ecosystems that will eat each other or they will eat them i think a food web shows the wait what zero yeah i think a food web thing is a a thingy all of the little parts in the car
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_037_comb what i notice is that the red is possible c two and the blue it can be like what they eat or or they consume it most of the biosphere is made up of sand and living creatures
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_027_comb i think what wetlands and deserts have to do is what when they live the animals live at a certain ecosystem that their natural habitat is in so a lizard can live in the desert and a fish can live in the wetlands
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_031_comb that there is a snow hair that will like eat like plants the plants might meet the animal like the purple and the grass mud with and the snow hair will eat the rat with the owls the rat can also eat the owl no wait the owl can eat the snow hair
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_003_comb they all live on the earth we have been that it has a whole bunch of subsystems is all about like what they eat and how and what they kill
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_033_comb the food web is they each have different types of food which they eat hunt kill or take the take them to their babies so that they can grow
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_029_comb systems have in common with the biosphere is where the animals and the people live and where certain things live like the spider it can sometimes live in the desert
myst_018219_2014-09-30_08-58-49_LS_1.1_025_comb i see all the ecosystems in the earth where other animals live like the burrow forest the wetlands and the desert a see the axles and the wheels which help the car move

myst_018219_2014-11-04_09-55-42_LS_3.1_022_comb it has to do what we have been talking about by the leaves they try to evaporate out of the bag but all the water just comes off the leaves and gets stuck to the top that they all have different shapes on them like the palmate has five like on your hands like you have five fingers i do not know
myst_018219_2014-11-04_09-55-42_LS_3.1_027_comb bye bye see you next time all of the human body cells it has something that we have been doing is we have been learning about leaves and how they work around with their cells inside of them they all feel different the respiratory system good how are you
myst_018219_2014-11-04_09-55-42_LS_3.1_009_comb they are all different by they all have different shapes like the palmate has five means five fingers palmate is what is it what is like a feather it is all about evaporating i do not know
myst_018219_2014-11-04_09-55-42_LS_3.1_020_comb i think the vascular system labels all of the things their patterns are different by the each sides of the leaf that it is a palmate i noticed that they are all different shapes and sizes how some leaves are different than others what does what mean one tube goes up the other tube goes down to hold the leaf together
myst_014013_2013-12-19_12-28-36_MX_1.3_022_comb the water went through the coffee filter and the sand stayed on top because the sand is bigger than the coffee filter that the mixture can only be that the solution can only be separated with the evaporation mixtures and solution i do not know marni i do not know magnetism and a sieve the magnet is picking up the paper clips from the mixture because out of everything only water can pass through the filter
myst_014013_2013-12-19_12-28-36_MX_1.3_021_comb i think we use the sieve because the water goes than the holes in the sieve the rocks are larger i do not know the water went through the sieve and the stones stayed on top take the paper clips out of the sand the sand will not stick to the magnet the paper clips stuck to the magnet because they are magnetized because some mixtures have different properties
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-44-15_MX_2.1_003_comb you are putting the powder into the water
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-44-15_MX_2.1_002_comb well we just had science and we learned how to separate well not really we just learned how to kind of how to weigh each solutions to find out how much each one how concentrated each one is i am good marney how are you the solution is saturated
myst_014013_2014-02-03_13-33-35_MX_3.1_002_comb we been doing a lot of mixtures and solutions good how are you marni that is actually exactly what we have been doing we have been adding salt to fifty milliliters of water and seeing how saturated it would get it is becoming saturated
myst_014013_2014-02-03_13-33-35_MX_3.1_003_comb well first of all a solution is a substance in which one of the materials dissolves into another so how you make them is you take a solvent and a solute and mix them together it is showing that the solution weighs sixty-seven grams the solution is becoming saturated they have to all be saturated
myst_014013_2014-02-03_13-33-35_MX_3.1_007_comb i think it means that i am not sure i believe that when you have done you have made a super saturated solution i believe well that happens because not all of the solution parts have dissolved i do not know
myst_014013_2014-02-03_13-33-35_MX_3.1_013_comb that means that the solution is saturated well they have to do with what we have been doing in science because salt is a solute and water is a solvent and when you mix them together you get a solution
myst_014013_2014-02-03_13-33-35_MX_3.1_016_comb it becomes saturated on the fourth scoop the water became saturated or the solution became saturated and you could not put any more solute in it
myst_014013_2014-02-03_13-33-35_MX_3.1_017_comb well it is showing that both of the fifty milliliters of water they both have fifty milliliters of water in them but the variable here is that one is a salt solution and the other one is just plain water that means it is saturated we figured this out by weighing
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-42-52_MX_2.2_009_comb i was right with my prediction marney but i mean what did you expect i am me anyway i saw that the one that had twenty grams of the solute was heavier than the one that had ten grams of the solute the salt well you can not unless you taste it because one has twenty grams of the solute and the other one has ten grams of the solute therefore making the one with twenty grams of the solute heavier because it has more things in it
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-42-52_MX_2.2_007_comb one has ten grams of the solute and another has twenty grams of the solute one is very heavy and three is not very heavy and two is kind of in the middle one of them well they both had seventy-five milliliters of water but one of them has ten grams of the solute let us say salt if you will and the other one has twenty grams of the solute or salt
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-42-52_MX_2.2_002_comb well kind of what we have been doing is trying to separate mixtures and a little bit of separating solutions if you know what i am saying so yeah and it has been a lot of fun marney i really like you can determine that by number one the color number two how much water or how much powder you put in and that is basically just it you know it is yeah
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-42-52_MX_2.2_015_comb well the solution one is very concentrated solution three is a little less but it is still more concentrated than solution two i am great marney how are you i am excited to start working number one is the most concentrated and number two is the least concentrated i do not really get what you just said can you kind of explain that to me
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-42-52_MX_2.2_005_comb well in this picture you can tell that the feather is much lighter than the rock by actually about ninety-eight grams i mean sorry not nine thousand, eight hundred and eighty-eight grams and the rock is eighty-eight grams heavier than the feather so the rock is at the bottom and the feather is at the top it is very interesting
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-42-52_MX_2.2_008_comb i am thinking that the one that has the most solute in it will be heavier because it has more grams or milliliters of the materials in this picture they are separating a mixture of gravel and water by using a screen
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_013_comb i think the paper clips will work better well this mixture the reason why we use the sieve is because the particle size of the gravel will really help us separate it because the gravel is bigger than the holes in the screen and the water the water is particles will pass through the screen
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_008_comb well one of the properties is particle size another one let us see there is density and there is other properties such as something else we call them tools that we use to separate mixtures i guess i am not really sure marni i am bad at science zero well the salt and the water is a solution
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_001_comb i am great marni how are you what do you want to talk about marni i do not really get it the important property that is being shown here is particle size and how it can really help you separate mixtures i believe it is the sand the salt is the one that works for this because the water evaporates from the salt mixture and it leaves the salt crystal
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_020_comb it means that we are evaporating out the solute well we talked about how to separate a mixture i mean a solution and yeah
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_003_comb well the difference between a mixture and a solution is that the solute in a solution dissolves into the solvent but a mixture just stays as it as it is and nothing dissolves am i right i am always right
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_016_comb because the gravel particles are bigger than the holes in the sieve and everything has particles that are smaller than the holes in the sieve so they pass through but the gravel does not so the gravel is separated from the mixture therefore well some of the materials in this mixture are magnetic so we can use the magnet to get them out and it will really help us separate it
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_014_comb well the paper clips are magnetic so they will come out with the magnet i think it is the gravel because the gravel gravel particles are smaller or i mean sorry bigger than the holes in the sieve and everything passes through because it is smaller
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_012_comb well because sometimes a certain tool will come in handy with a different with one mixture but it really will not do anything for another mixture
myst_014013_2013-12-16_14-10-11_MX_1.3_018_comb i think we use the filter because the particle size of the sand is bigger than the particle the holes in the filter we have been learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_027_comb we know that it is definitely very possible to get back a solvent from the solution and but it is sometimes extremely difficult and sometimes it takes a long time for instance with salt and water you have to evaporate the water from the mixture so that you get the salt all of them are mixtures
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_017_comb well what you did is you took the coffee filter and you poured the mixture of salt and water i mean sand and water into the coffee filter and it filtered through and sand stayed in the filter and water came out the salad is well the salad is kind of wavy and the trail mix is it looks very crunchy
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_008_comb that is a mixture and that that is what we call it and what is important about that is without mixtures we would not have trail mix the salt dissolved into the water are being separated in a very convenient way the trail mix is being separated in this animation trail mix gets separated and that is important because it is separate
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_005_comb well there is salad there is trail mix there is a mixture of paper clips and something else or wood chips and then there is a mixture of water and marbles separated and that is important because it is being separated
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_020_comb well when you mix sand and water it floats around for a little bit and then it settles out with one layer of water on the top one layer of sand on the bottom and with the salt the salt dissolves into the water and with the wood chip clips they just stay mixed cause nothing really happens cause there is not any water and none of them
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_019_comb what it is doing is the particle size is kind of key here and the sand does not the sand does not go through the filter because the holes in the cup or the filter are smaller than the grains of sand but the water goes through because it is small solid material is the solute the theme here is that we are separating it
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_014_comb the water went through the screen and the marbles stayed on the top on the left is what it looked like before it was separated and the pile on the right is what it looked like after it was separate the solute i believe is the one that dissolves
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_016_comb screen is separating the water and the marbles by because the marbles are bigger than the holes in the screen and the water is passing through the salad is a mixture and everything except for the water
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_023_comb well the salt is the part of the mixture that will dissolve and the what is important about this kind of mixture is that it dissolves and that is a very unique kind of mixture
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_022_comb when one object dissolves into another object it is called a solution with a solute and a solvent and salt and water is a solution and that is an example
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_009_comb salt is a mixture that will eventually settle out the salt and the water is a solute and a solute and solution and a and the wood chips and a and the wood chips and paper clips are a mixture
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-37-22_MX_1.1_026_comb it is definitely possible but it would be very difficult because the grapetastic powder has dissolved into the water so it would be difficult but not impossible to get it back those are the materials to make a solution
myst_014013_2014-02-05_12-26-56_MX_3.2_011_comb the substance c weighs just a little bit more than the other one because it is not pure water it has something else in it too i think that it is the the epsom salt because you can see that the crystals are spiky and needle like and they are clear white
myst_014013_2014-02-05_12-26-56_MX_3.2_007_comb that is how you weigh a solution one is a citric acid solution and one is an epsom salt solution so you have to put them on petri dishes and make them evaporate you can see that they are very different i think that the citric acid is in the middle one the salt is dissolved in the water because it has square clear white crystals i am good marni how are you
myst_014013_2014-02-05_12-26-56_MX_3.2_017_comb you can see what crystals what identification they match and that you can tell you what type of crystal it is and therefore what was what the mystery solution was and it is very interesting
myst_014013_2014-02-05_12-26-56_MX_3.2_008_comb that is how much the solution weighs for example the citric acid weighs sixty-seven grams the epsom salt solution weighs forty grams and the sugar solution weighs one hundred grams i do not really understand because the citric acid just dissolves a lot faster than the sugar or maybe it is the other way around
myst_014013_2014-02-05_12-26-56_MX_3.2_010_comb that is actually exactly what we used in science it is a solubility chart and it measures how much how many grams it you need to saturated that fifty milliliters of water so yeah
myst_014013_2014-02-05_12-26-56_MX_3.2_014_comb well those are the salt crystals or the solute crystals in the petri dishes and it shows that the citric acid has feathery flat clear white crystals the epsom salt has spiky needle like clear white crystals and the salt has square clear white crystals substance three is the one that would take more the epsom salt they are making a solution
myst_014013_2014-02-11_12-41-40_MX_4.2_006_comb we can see that there was no reaction because the it did not bubble or fizz the solution did not bubble or fizz at all and it left behind crystals that is a chemical reaction this tells us that
myst_014013_2014-02-11_12-41-40_MX_4.2_011_comb i think what happened is when he sealed or whoever is doing the experiment sealed the bag the bubbles the carbon bubbles that were formed by the chemical reaction could not get out and it made the bag puff up to accommodate for all of those carbon bubbles
myst_014013_2014-02-11_12-41-40_MX_4.2_003_comb a chemical reaction is taking place and when the reaction is done the powder sinks to the bottom because the weight of all the carbon bubbles is still in the closed bag so it adds to it is mass whereas the open bag does not have any carbon bubble weight in it so it stays it is lighter
myst_014013_2014-02-11_12-41-40_MX_4.2_004_comb a chemical reaction occurred the reactant were baking soda calcium chloride and the produce was a chemical reaction and a product this tells what the eventual mass it
myst_014013_2014-02-11_12-41-40_MX_4.2_010_comb i see that there is a layer of powdery white film on the bottom and it is till full of water well the reactants and the products the reactant was the calcium chloride and the baking soda and the product was a chemical reaction great marney how are you
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_002_comb well we have not had science yet today but we have been studying how to separate solutions and mixtures well whatever the powder tastes like it is probably going to be very strong and the more powder you put in to the water the flavor is probably going to be stronger and the less powder the more diluted the taste is
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_008_comb well if there is more powder crystals if you will in the water then you can tell that it has a higher concentration i think but i might be wrong i think i am wrong but i might be wrong no i think that the lighter colored solutions are more diluted if you will than the darker colored ones
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_006_comb well the one on the right has more powder than the one on the i mean sorry the one on the left has more powder than the one on the well marney the dark colored solutions have a lot more powder in them
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_007_comb well the one on the left which has more powder in it has more is more purple and it is more purple and it is a brighter purple and the one on the right has less purple in it because it does not have as much powder
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_005_comb one of the cups the cup on the right has a lot more grapetastic powder in it it is probably going to taste pretty bland compared to the other solution but it it might taste a little bit better
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_020_comb well marney if you add more water to the drink it will be more bland and more diluted and less concentrated than the other drink that has less water
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_003_comb well the definition of a solution is a is one material dissolves into the other and so the solvent dissolves into the solute and that is what a solution is and how they work is that when you put them together it creates a solution like salt water
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_016_comb it is probably going to taste really gross and just really disgusting and just really really gross i can tell that they have more powder and are more concentrated if the color is brighter than the and the other things are
myst_014013_2013-12-18_12-29-28_MX_2.1_018_comb it is probably going to be a lot more bland and a lot more tasteless than the really concentrated one number one is the most concentrated and number two is the least concentrated i am great marni how are you number one is the most concentrated and number two is the most dilute and number is in the
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-46-02_MX_2.2_013_comb number one is the most concentrated and number two is the least concentrated one has more solute and one has less solute
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-46-02_MX_2.2_009_comb my prediction was right marni because the twenty gram solute solution was heavier than the ten gram solute solution well the water the milliliter amount of water is the same but one of them the one on the left has ten grams of it is solute and the other one has twenty grams of it is solute so yes that is it c is the most dilute and b is the most concentrated
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-46-02_MX_2.2_002_comb today marni we learned how to find out how concentrated or dilute a solution is by weighing them well first the rock is ninety grams which is much heavier than the feather which is two grams so the rock is heavier than the feather
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-46-02_MX_2.2_003_comb well there is many ways you can find out if it is colored you can tell by it is colored if it is like a really deep blue or like a blight blue and but the number one way you can find that out is by weighing it and the heaviest one is the most concentrated
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-46-02_MX_2.2_010_comb well in the grape drink mix picture the one on the left is very dilute the one in the middle is very in the middle if you will and the one on the right is very concentrated and same with the salt well you can not really tell with the salt water solution
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-46-02_MX_2.2_008_comb i think the one on the right the twenty gram one will be heavier and more concentrated therefore i am well marney how are you that does not really have anything to do with what we have been doing in science the penny is heavier than the cork the cork is less dense than the penny
myst_014013_2014-01-13_13-56-20_MX_2.4_002_comb it is a lot of fun and we just today did in science how to tell if salt water is it will float i think so because there is lots of weird stuff on the bottom
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_035_comb there is definitely a reaction happening because it is bubbling and fizzing i am doing great how are you i am just going to take a wild guess i think it is a reactant it provides evidence of no chemical reaction because nothing is bubbling or that is a chemical reaction that makes the product turn pink actually there is a chemical reaction because something is happening to the bike
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_039_comb it is rusting because the water is soaking into it is bones they are going to create a chemical reaction by mixing baking soda and calcium chloride with water
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_019_comb they do a little bit because the vinegar has blue and yellow molecules and the baking soda has white molecules and the product has gray blue and yellowish white molecules it turns into a gas actually there is a reaction because the bubbles are coming to the top
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_020_comb it means that they were both combined it is a they are a mix of all of the reactants they are mixing sodium hydroxide with no they can not because now they are part of a new solution or chemical reaction thing
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_040_comb there is no chemical reaction i do not think because is reacting it is just rusting
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_026_comb the molecular structure for the sodium hydroxide is that they are little white molecules that are very even and lined up and the hydrochloric acid molecular structure is kind of everywhere and then the water is is just kind of everywhere as well but the product is also everywhere but it is different colors they look very foggy
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_031_comb there is not a chemical reaction this is just condensation when the ice is dropped into the water it makes it cold and that makes the glass sweat on second thought no there is no reaction because it is not reacting a chemical reaction is happening that is causing them to glow and when you bend it activates the reaction and it glows
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_045_comb that is not a chemical reaction it is a solution because nothing is reacting it is just dissolving the fact that it changes there is some little white stuff on they bottom the water because it turned into gas the the bubbles in the carbonated water are carbon bubbles the final product turned pink
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_007_comb that is exactly what we have been doing in science we have been a chemical reaction is happening it bubbled up and fizzed a lot i am not quite sure we call it a product there is no reaction because it is not mixing anything it is just that the carbon and the carbonated water bubbles are coming up to the top it bubbled up and created a gas
myst_014013_2014-02-10_13-38-04_MX_4.1_043_comb it is important because the chemical reaction is causing it to glow first it was the molecules were all blue and then they turned purple a a few of them turned purple well we have just kinda been talking about separating solutions and mixtures well there was more salt in it so it needed more
myst_014013_2014-01-15_12-31-58_MX_3.1_003_comb well the materials necessary for a solution is a solute and a solvent and for a solution to be made the solvent must dissolve into the solute well the water has not dissolved all of the salt it is not completely saturated
myst_014013_2014-01-15_12-31-58_MX_3.1_013_comb that just means that not all of the salt has dissolved all of it dissolved that is actually exactly what we have been doing in science we had the the gram scoops and we put the salt in it and put it in the fifty milliliters of water they are putting the epsom salt into the water and some of it is dissolving and some of it is sinking to the bottom
myst_014013_2014-01-15_12-31-58_MX_3.1_005_comb well the salt is the solvent and the water is the solute and the scoop is how you get the salt into the water i do not really know what the special solution is that just means that not all of the salt has dissolved yet they both have to have the same amount of solvent and the same amount of solute of as each other the epsom salt has all dissolved
myst_014013_2014-01-15_12-31-58_MX_3.1_019_comb by doing the gram adding some of the salt sinks to the bottom i am okay i am on crutches but i am good the salt solution is heavier because it has salt in it and the other one just has water that means that it has not dissolved yet
myst_014013_2014-01-15_12-31-58_MX_3.1_002_comb the i mean we have been yesterday like i told you we have been doing mixtures and solutions and how to tell the mass of them especially in ones where you can not see when the result is the same as the stuff going in we know that they are mass has been added together to make the result
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_038_comb water is well water is required because it is the only thing that evaporates in a solution and it leaves the salt behind because the salt is not a liquid well today in science class we did a experiment where we had a mixture of magnetite gravel sand or not sand powder and salt and we had to get it back get separate them and get them all back
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_017_comb we have learned that the salt is fifteen grams i do not really get what you mean by a property of it well when you mix the things you are also mixing their weight or their mass so fifty grams fifteen grams is sixty-five grams
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_026_comb well that so the epsom salt was put into the mixture but it was dissolved into the water so they can not get it out it is called evaporation marney and what happens is it turns into water vapor and it goes up into the sky but since the salt is not a liquid it does not evaporate it just stays there and turns into salt crystals
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_008_comb well let us think the salt is the solvent and the water is the solute in this picture and it when they are mixed together they create a solution
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_028_comb this animation shows a mixture because the salt did not dissolve into the mixture and they got it and it is they got it out with the coffee filter considered a solution marney
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_004_comb it is trying to make a point that when you mix sand and water it will the sand will not dissolve into the water it will just stay there and but when you mix salt and water the salt will dissolve into the water that tells us that it is a mixture and not a solution i believe it is a mixture
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_019_comb that the mass of part of the mixture is being added up and put into the final result i believe the name for the water is the solvent
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_022_comb in this animation they are mixing flour and water and then they are taking a coffee filter and filtering the the mixture through the coffee filter and the flour came out and the water filtered through
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_003_comb the thing that dissolves into the solute is the solvent there are many ways to separate the components of a solution but one of the ways is to take a coffee filter and filter it through and some of and the solvent will go through and the solute will
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_025_comb the epsom salt was filtered well pardon me marney can you please repeat that well the significance the clock has is that things do not just evaporate right away it takes some time and it is showing that time is passing before it is evaporating right marney
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_033_comb well one way to separate for example a solution like salt and water is to put them into petrie dishes and evaporate the water from the salt and that will leave only the solvent
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_034_comb the they are putting the salt water into a shallow dish and the water is evaporating from the solution to make miniature salt crystal
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_012_comb well the salt water or the end result is sixty-five grams because the water because it is a mixture of the water and the salt and the water is fifty grams and the salt is fifteen grams so when you add that together you get sixty-five grams when you make the salt water
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_011_comb well the mixed end result is fifty grams because the peanuts are twenty grams plus the raisins which are another twenty grams is forty grams plus the candy which is ten grams we will get fifty grams because we have mixed them all together and that is why marney the water is evaporating and leaving the salt behind
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_030_comb that this is a solution because the citric acid dissolved into the water well the water or the solvent is the one that is doing the dissolving and it dissolves the salt to make the solution and it is very important you can not have it without how are you marney
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_006_comb i am not quite sure but i believe the solute is the liquid or the well the mass of all of the things that are going into the mixture is also adding up their mass so twenty twenty ten is fifty so yeah well the salt and water is a solution and the sand and water is not a solution
myst_014013_2013-12-16_13-51-41_MX_1.2_032_comb that back it is considered a solution well what happens is the what they are doing in the animation is they are weighing the salt water and they figure out that it is sixty-five grams and they did this by putting it on the scale and putting in sixty-five grams
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_006_comb it helps all the bees find where the nectar is so that they can all get the food for the bee hive
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_015_comb i think that is the our nervous system the system that you use so that in case like if you get tickled or surprised it it it makes you jump or react in some big way so that you can not you will not get hurt or anything
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_011_comb the man got tickled so he and he saw the stimulus or the mosquito and so he smacked it
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_009_comb the dog reacts to the door bell because it gets scares so it starts to bark and it wants to protect its territory so it barks it does it lifts up its tail and makes itself look bigger to scare away anything that seems like a threat to it is territory
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_018_comb helps you to react to just about anything like in this picture the ball is coming towards her so and she sees it so her nervous system is telling her exactly when she needs to hit to swing the bat so that she hits the ball the juice falling over is a stimulus to the kid because he got worried and juice splattered all over him so he stood up and like got all surprised
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_010_comb the man is reacting to the tickle on his hand from the bug landing on it and so he just smacks the back of his hand so that the could kill the bug
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_014_comb well the man got a stimulus because of the door bell the door bell is the man stimulus because he got all surprised and his heart raced and he woke up and kind of jumped out of his seat really fast
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_002_comb well yesterday we looked at our grass that we have been growing and we have been learning about systems like the circulatory system a couple of other systems
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_004_comb they are all doing what any animal would normally do and it looks like that one dog in the top left is in the same room as the man in the bottom right the rattle snakes rattle
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_013_comb like i just said he he got worried when he saw the juice spilling over so he stood up and got all surprised it is the spinal cord the brain and the human nerves that are all throughout the body
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_005_comb i think it is showing us well i guess it is showing us some what bees do to get other bees to come and harvest from these flowers so that they can work on building their hives
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_017_comb the brain sends it sends the entire reaction throughout your body so your body knows what to do so like when you get scared your brain tells you to react and makes you do something big like jump or for a dog bark like
myst_022205_2014-12-17_11-53-29_LS_4.1_007_comb i see a snake reacting to an animal trying to warn it that it does not want to come near the snake because the snake will eat it if it comes near it because the snake does not want to be bothered lots and lots of cells all over the body and some of the cells are different from other cells and the body is made up of ninety cells and ten you
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_039_comb that the human is made up of many different cells and the yeast is just made up of one cell lots of skin cells and muscle cells and other systems like brain brain the brain and the circulatory system and the respiratory system
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_019_comb those are the organs which are made up of cells that are inside a human and a butterfly and like a butterfly it it it has some similar cells intestines like us like they have also got a stomach a
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_024_comb if you did not have the mouth you would choke on food and it would not get through your body correctly and so with the mouth you would grind food up with your teeth and dissolve it slightly with your saliva not saliva i just said saliva with your spit and make it go down your throat easier so it can work through your
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_032_comb pink muscles in in the leg and they are a bunch of tiny purple spots on the muscle
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_047_comb the human digestive system needs a bunch of parts like the mouth so that it can shred up food and make it wet so that it can get down the throat and into the stomach where it can dissolve a bit and then the energy can go into the small intestine and big intestine to make energy and then the other bad stuff goes out the other end
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_023_comb it is an entire system that works together with tiny little bits so that you can digest things and make it come out the other end properly that they are kind of large tubes sort of that are like really pink with a bunch of tiny purple dots sort of like molecules floating around them it is a butterfly that is
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_011_comb that the big sections are brain cells so we learned about cells and how cells make up systems and systems you need so you can digest things and run and move and do all that that stuff that you need to do
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_012_comb it is the same picture that we looked earlier with the big the big slivers on of cells on the top and then the little chopped up bits in the middle and then the darker blue circular bits on the bottom we both have a bunch of cells and we both have systems and organisms inside of us
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_015_comb that humans are made up of many cells not just one big cell stomach is filled with acid so that when the food gets into your stomach it can grind up the food into a bunch of tiny parts and digest it basically so that you could get energy through the small intestine and big intestine
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_020_comb they both have organs like intestines and the stomach and the throat and some of your and the and they both have systems like the circulatory system and the digestive system i think that is yeast or some sort of organism maybe some sort of cell
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_053_comb the intestines are what you need so that you can so it get gather the energy from the food so that you can run around and do all that stuff and if you did not have the intestines you would not be able to get the bad stuff out i think that is yeast which is a bunch of different yeast cells well yeast is actually one cell one system one organism
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_049_comb it helps you get food down into the stomach so that you can digest the food we were learning and yeast is a living cell and that it is a and that that is a bunch of different yeast particles or cells or systems
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_054_comb you can use them to drink food to drink and eat many different things and if you did not have it you would die because you can not eat anything or get any energy the organisms and systems inside of our bodies
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_036_comb i see many different skin cells all over the arm like tiny ones at the top and and between the top and the middle and then there are a bunch in the middle and a couple on the bottom
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_022_comb it is one big system they all all of the systems work together to make your body work so that you can digest food and make it come out the other end properly they are both a bunch of different cells in one system the pink is the entire muscle cell those are all the brain cells in the brain organism
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_030_comb the human cells are somewhat similar to the plant cells they are just kind of different because they each because with the leaf cells they are sticking out and are kind of like big and cup shaped but with the humans they are just a bunch of tiny little circular cells the human because yeast is made up of one cell the human is made up of 1000000000000s of cells
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_008_comb it seems like kind of pink with a bunch of tiny purple spots and there are lines in between each pink section and the purple dots are there are a couple purple dots between the pink sections and there are a couple purple dots in each of the pink sections
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_041_comb fly is made up of many cells and organisms too
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_040_comb human because it shows a bunch of different cells on the one arm and the yeast is made up of just one cell and i know that for a fact that the human is made up of 1000000000000s and 1000000000000s of cells and the yeast is made up of one they have needs that are very similar to our like we need to eat so that we can get energy just like butterflies need to eat so that they can fly around
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_035_comb that all those big blue parts are the brain cells they are all connected by tiny tubes and that there are a lot of brain cells in the brain getting food through all the way through your body in the front in the top front end and out the bottom back end i am doing fine
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_018_comb they need food just like us and they their cells need food just like our cells need food so if we eat just like they eat they then we will get more energy from the cells collecting energy
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_037_comb that they all connect together to make the whole arm work as with the skin on it otherwise the skin would all just fall off and you would have a big naked spot on your arm to digest the food so that you can use the food as energy
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_048_comb if you did not have the mouth you would not be able to eat because if you have the mouth you can chew things up and make it wet with your saliva so that it goes down the throat they are a lot of big sections that are connected with a bunch of tiny threads of tubing sort of and there is like a lot of it
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_029_comb they are both a bunch of different cells but the but with the human it is a bunch of different cells in one system with the yeast it is a bunch of it it is a bunch of different cells in a bunch of separate systems cells and organisms and systems
myst_022205_2014-12-15_11-31-47_LS_2.3_043_comb it is showing the organisms of a human and a butterfly that like a butterfly has a stomach and a human has a stomach a butterfly has intestines and a human has intestines if you did not have the esophagus you would not be able to get food into the rest of the of the digestive system so none of it would work and it would overpower you and you would die good how are you
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_021_comb the plant does not have any sunlight so the plant is dying and the plant needs sunlight just like us need food
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_018_comb it is showing how the plant gets its light and it is carbon dioxide and its oxygen and its water and all the stuff that it really needs because if it did not have all of that stuff it would die die
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_020_comb with photosynthesis the they use the sunlight to make their own food and they also use water as their what they use to drink because everything really needs water
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_003_comb that is pretty much exactly what we have been doing in science we would get yeast and put it put it in a bag and fill it the bag with water and we put an animal cracker in with it i am not sure can you help me with that sunlight and water and maybe a little bit of fertilizer
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_015_comb i see a hamburger which a plant definitely does not need although i do see seeds on the top of the bun which could be something that you would use to grow a plant like that it is showing that the plant needs sunlight to survive
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_002_comb i have been studying systems and molecules and lately we have been working on like putting water in with yeast and a bunch of other things in with yeast
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_005_comb i think that the cookie is in the bag because the cookie has sugar in it and when yeast and sugar mix together the the yeast starts to bubble and sort of have a little yeast party
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_017_comb that is a house next to the plant i think that the plant would need that sort of plant would need someone to to take care of it like someone specifically to water it and to and to make sure that it gets sunlight
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_006_comb they are living organisms they basically interact with each other almost like humans but differently they need they need to interact with each other so that they can do their job sort of like a man at work can you help me with that i am not totally sure
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_009_comb maybe because one has more water and sunlight and the other one does not have quite as much as the other one i think it is showing that the plants also need air to survive that plants need water and sunlight so that they can survive just like we need food and water to survive
myst_022205_2014-12-09_12-01-20_LS_2.1_007_comb i think that those cells are yeast or yeast particles what it shows tomato juice i think and it is definitely not something that the plant would need well the plants use photosynthesis to get the it from i am going to start over good how are you
myst_022205_2014-12-09_11-59-37_LS_1.1_003_comb sorry i am on the wrong website i have been learning about systems and molecules and stuff like that
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_005_comb it looks like it is uhm sniffing for something so i am guessing that it has got good senses so it can find things easily with its nose and it looks like it has got pretty big claws so it can probably dig pretty well so that it can use that for protection probably
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_002_comb those are all animals that have circulatory systems nervous systems uhm and skeletal systems all the different systems just like humans that they all have systems inside of them number two his teeth so he can rip open his prey
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_025_comb it is showing uhm a person is reflexes like when a nerve gets tapped on their knee their knee it their leg will kick
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_013_comb number one its wings because of their bright powerful colors it makes the predators kind of confused almost and that is a similar color to another kind of butterfly that is very poisonous so that helps ward off predators so that they do not want to go near it his webbed feet
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_020_comb there is like the dog uhm and animals go together and then there is also uhm like people would go together with the things that they its tail puffing up or it blasting a fart at it
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_010_comb it looks quite camouflaged with its orange stripes uhm so that it looks kind of like the background just like the white like coral and the pink like strands of coral that look almost like him the tortoises shell is hard and can probably protect him very well
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_024_comb no i think that a dog has to be trained so that it knows what to do when you throw a frisbee for it is a non learned behavior that is an instinct that when the baby turtles get out of their egg they see the water and think zero that looks nice and it looks like protection so they go straight to the water
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_030_comb the cat fell out of the tree and so i think that is an instinct uhm so it is not it is a non learned behavior so when they fall out of the tree they flip over so that they can land solidly and will not get hurt
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_014_comb because there is another type of butterfly that is really really poisonous and so when a predator sees its wings it thinks of that other butterfly and leaves because it is like i do not want i do not want to mess with that butterfly because it is really poisonous
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_008_comb well it looks he has got pretty big claws also so he can probably dig really well but it does not look like he has quite of a nose so he probably can not smell all that well but it does look like he has almost like gills so he can probably swim pretty well and he has got that hard shell that he can probably kind of climb inside like a hermit crab and be protected like that
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_004_comb uhm i am not sure can you help me on that the flock of geese always follows one goose but they take turns which is basically what their main behavior uhm trying to get away from the cold weather
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_028_comb i think that is a learned behavior because you have to learn how to make those letters and how to write those letters and how to just write
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_017_comb it is showing the adaptations of both the animals the wolf which is the predator and the skunk which is the prey the skunk looks like it is puffing up almost like a cat with its tail when it is gets scared and it looks like it is getting it is trying to make itself look bigger so that it will scare away the wolf where as the wolf looks like he is kind of walking away because the badger looks scary
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_027_comb i think this is a non learned behavior because all reflexes are really not learned unless they are special reflexes the person is getting burned so their hand flicks back because it really hurt so they just want to get away from that thing that really hurt
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_006_comb that is part of the skins adaptation if the skunk could not smell it would have trouble hunting or smelling prey or basically smelling predators i am doing well but you look quite fat man
myst_022205_2015-01-15_11-18-01_LS_4.2_003_comb that they all have systems like circulatory systems digestive systems nervous systems skeletal system and muscular system
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_014_comb biosphere i think is probably all of the like land that stays together and holds everything together like with the water and the soil and the life forms like trees and people and birds
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_007_comb car is a system just like the human body and the earth it has many different parts like the engine which helps it it which really if you did not have would not let the entire thing work which means it is part of the system and you need all the parts for it to be a system
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_011_comb they all can it hold it like sits on the earth to make the whole system work like other systems they are all part of one whole system they all have many different interacting parts that work together to make the whole thing work
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_019_comb what some things eat like a bird eats a rabbit and let us see what some things are like similar you know like all the parts work together to make it be able to move and drive people places
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_010_comb the earth is and entire system with many different subsystems like different states and countries and there are also different oceans like the atlantic and the pacific and for the states there are there is like colorado and new york and other states and other countries
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_020_comb they are all connected as a different types of living forms like the decomposers and the animals
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_004_comb because it has many different parts like that all work together and to let you be able to move and interact with other people we have been working on the the systems a lot of systems like there are many different systems and stuff like human body cars you know
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_015_comb they are all part of the biosphere they are all what is inside of the biosphere making it an entire system really well they are all systems like the human body system one of them is the human body system one of them is the earth which is a system one of them is a suitcase which is even a system and a television and a car they are all systems
myst_022205_2014-11-13_11-43-06_LS_1.1_017_comb i think it is one of the wetlands sort of but it is a little bit dryer it has got more life forms than the dry lands does i am guessing like a maple tree leaf it looks almost like a hand because there are five different vein segments just like humans have five fingers
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_007_comb a feather leaf i guess sort of like feathery maybe from a tree that produces a lot of sap because it looks like it is dark and has been taken care for care of a lot
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_003_comb they all look similar but very different the one on the bottom left looks sort of like grass the one on the top looks kind of spiky and the one on the right is looks more round and smooth
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_010_comb i think it is showing how the bush can take in light and let out other light like carbon and it can also take in air and push out air like a carbon dioxide and it and air
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_012_comb that looks like a plant that is being watered from the top but it does not really have any oxygen so i do not think it will live very long
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_011_comb the veins in the plant need to be transported it need to transport the water just like the veins in the leaves in that are from the bush need to transport water so that the leaves can get water and to become stronger leaves
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_006_comb that it is wide and is a lot like a hand and maybe that it is
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_004_comb so the one that is a blade of grass is the two sides are parallel and the one that is a sort of spiky looks sort of like a palm and the one that is smooth looks sort of almost like a feather
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_002_comb we have been working on studying plants like we are growing grass right now or wheat wheat not grass i am very good but you just scared me half to death but how are you
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_008_comb that it is probably fairly new compared to like an old leaf it would be kind of dried up and shriveled sort of
myst_022205_2014-12-16_10-23-54_LS_3.1_009_comb so that the tree can get it is sap in into the leaves and so that it can run the water through the leave is veins just like a human is vein runs the human is blood throughout it is body exchanging our gases so that we can survive
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_013_comb the heart is what controls it all it pumps the blood in and out of the of the in and out around the entire body and if we did not have it we would not our blood would just go everywhere and we would not be able to survive because the blood would not be getting to all the parts of our body they move the blood around throughout the entire body
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_010_comb the red part that the blood cells are traveling through are the veins and the blue part is skin cells it is letting in blood and then pushing out blood i think that is a heart it is showing all the little different parts inside of the circulatory system
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_007_comb i think it is trying to show me how they connect like how the arteries connect into the heart and the veins connect into the heart that is showing how the heart pushes out the blood through the blood vessels and the blood moves through the blood vessels around the body blood vessels that are pushing the blood around
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_019_comb it is the blood that moves all around the body so that it can get to things and try and heal them make form a scab with the blood if there is something cut there and it also moves to places that are just injured in any short sort of shape or form lung the lungs definitely the lungs
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_011_comb that the blue part is cell are cells and the red part is capillary i am doing fine talked to you earlier the heart pumps blood around the body
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_003_comb that is the circulatory system of a dog and a human we have been working on looking at systems and that happens to be the most previous one we have been looking at and actually the heart is part of the circulatory system which we dissected a little while ago so yeah
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_015_comb the blood vessels are what are pushing the blood around the body like the blood vessel is show is pushing the blood into the heart and the vein veins are taking it out to other parts
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_032_comb so that we can breathe out two so the trees can breathe and so that we can breathe c two so that tree so that trees can get rid of the c two because they do not want that it will kill them
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_008_comb two is being pushed out along with c zero h twenty and c two is going into the blood cells and blood vessels
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_006_comb it is showing how the arteries and veins connect to it to the heart and the whole system is basically arteries veins and the heart
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_004_comb their systems look quite similar i mean they both have the red and blue veins running through them and actually they are light red and dark red not red and blue
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-47-02_LS_3.4_036_comb grams the diaphragm lets them inhale and exhale by getting bigger and tenser and then by relaxing so that it can bring in the air and push out the air is the circulatory system we have been looking at that in science through a and b the mouth and the nose
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_011_comb i think grams the diagram so because if we did not have that our lungs would not be able to expand and contract if you the exchange of gases is needed because we breathe in the c two and trees breathe in just two or oxygen i think it is in the inside of a human is body
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_017_comb we have also been working on this systems living systems inside of us and that is just one tiny system that is in our lungs and if we did not have that we would not be able to get c two into our lungs and we would not be able to breathe
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_004_comb that is showing a human breathing because it squeezes the lungs in so that pushes out the air and then and then opens them so that the air is going in so that they can breathe and survive
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_012_comb a and b through the nose and the mouth so that you can get it down your your trasha trachea and your bronchi and so that you can get it into the lungs
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_005_comb if we did not breathe we would pass out and eventually die because we can not breathe two but trees can we we breathe two and we breathe out or we breathe in c two and we breathe out two so that and then the trees breathe in two and breathe out c two so that we can both breathe
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_001_comb doing great how are you i am observing c two coming out of the blood cells and two replacing it and then the blood is going to the heart probably i am guessing
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_020_comb that is showing the diaphragm work with the lungs and the trachea and also the nose and the mouth so that it can take in two and c two so that we can breathe good hello miss lady how are you
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_016_comb well i have been working on growing grass and we have been studying the grass and stuff and the grass is starting to get pretty tall so yeah that is pretty much it
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_022_comb inhaling and exhaling air is exchanging your gas so your gases so you can breathe like you inhale c two and you exhale two
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_003_comb i think that is showing how the air gets into your lungs it is showing the little things that let out the air into your lungs so that you can breathe i am not totally sure can you help me with that h the alveoli and yeah the alveoli h
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_028_comb a and b the mouth and the nose
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_024_comb those are the tubes that the air goes into so that they can get the air into the alveoli alvoil i can not i do not know how to pronounce it a l v e zero l i so that that can put the air into your lungs so you can breathe in and then it sucks the air back in so you can breathe out
myst_022205_2014-12-16_11-34-18_LS_3.3_009_comb the c two and two are exchanging through the lungs through the blood cells from the heart and the bringing it to the heart when the electricity is flowing in it in a circle a battery is connected to a motor to make the motor run
myst_997279_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_002_comb w it it buzzed is and and part of it spun around in circles when the switch is is open then the motor can not run cause the switch is con it connects the wi is together so the motor can run and and if the switch closes then the motor can run cause it is connecting all the wire
myst_997279_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_026_comb the ye electricity from the battery goes goes to one light into both lights and then e they both lights are connected so e we if one end saint end is not flowing then it can still get pe electricity when you by a circuit then it can turn off the light and when you open a circuit then it can turn on the light
myst_997279_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_028_comb a on each side of the battery to e we put and so there is electricity flying to the light bulbs and then one took you connect the electricity in between the light bulb it flows from the battery up the wire and and goes into and then goes into the bulb
myst_997279_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_008_comb if the y battery is wires connected to the wrong end of the battery the motor can not run and then the switch has to face the correct way for the battery for it to make the motor w there is a switch on it to make the motor turn on and off the energy from it you can make the make a motor or a light run
myst_997279_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_018_comb en it will be then what is trying to turn on will be off then if you by the switch it it will turn on energy electricity is is from the battery to both ends and then ne e comes and then it goes straight into the light bulb
myst_997279_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_016_comb a circuit it is is could is when n you have a bunch of wires connected to each other with a switch if the switch is ope
myst_997279_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_032_comb when wa two wires are connected to the battery and one wire is connected to the light bulbs it makes it so that there is energy flowing towards the bulbs a battery is connected to wires to make two lights turn on
myst_997279_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_018_comb the magnet has to be es steel well have to be magnetizing does anything that you are trying to pick up with what you are magnetizing also has to be steel neh in that it you can magnetize e some things by rubbing ing them on a magnet
myst_997279_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006_comb that it that you have that you have to zero connect a certain side of the magnet together to get it to magnetize you need a certain si a t you need to rub a certain side to the magnet and then rub and then touch that side to a certain any side of the object to you are trying to magnetize
myst_997279_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_028_comb i found out that magnets it is si si it is harder to it would get them apart when they are just together with nothing in between them but it is easier to get them apart when there is a when there is is a little chip
myst_997279_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_004_comb no we rubbed a paper clip on a magnet and then tried to connect it to another paper clip without hooking it together the magnets magnetizing the nail so it can pick up the paper clip
myst_997279_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_024_comb we took a scale and put a stick that had a magnet on it in a hole the scale had it and then a magnet on the other side so they would connect then we used wa and then we used washers then we put in washers to see how much how many washers it took to we make the magnets go apart
myst_997279_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_012_comb the energy from the battery goes through the switch and around the nail making in and field around and it it is a ooh it is an electromagnet
myst_997279_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016_comb if you need to move something heavy and metal moved to a different place a switch turns the magnet on and off cause it is kind of like completing a circuit
myst_997279_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_008_comb the teacher did an example with the projector with regular magnet you can not drop things if you want to drop it you have to pull it off
myst_997279_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007_comb when this if the switch is not closed then it can not make the nail into a magnet cause it all has to be connected for it for the nail to be a magnet if it is not able to pick up any washers with in the switch it is open it was kind of like making a circuit
myst_997279_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014_comb if you can start picking up the washers with it then you can tell it is magnetic we connected a battery to a switch then we connected the battery switch to a big metal nail zero by wrapping a wire around it then we picked up washers
myst_997279_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009_comb he connect he first connected the er battery and switch and then wrapped it around and then they they wrapped the wire around the nail and had one of us come up to flip the switch and see how many washers they could pick up
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_006_comb well the two the three straws one on the top that holds the holds the whole plane up and then the stick and the straws are the body of the plane and the propeller and the rubber band a are the ones that make the speed and make it move
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_010_comb that they all have a different purpose the cork is what we are going to launch and then the rubber stopper helps it stay up and then well the the straws hold up and the stick holds the rubber band and the propeller and the straws hold up the whole plane
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_003_comb well that is pretty much what we did so far and we are going to start making this actually making it tomorrow can i see a picture of
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_022_comb well we were going to put it higher on like a stack of books or something like that and then we are going to see if it will go farther first we are going to do it on the floor or something flat and then we are going to see on the books to see if it would go farther or if it would go like not as far
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_017_comb probably the flipper base and the stick that holds it up and the rubber stop yep the weight may affect how far it goes stick is holding it up and the flipper base is how we hold it up and launch it can you show me a picture of the flipper
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_002_comb we have been making predictions and questions on the flipper and the launcher of the flipper well the rubber band the propeller made the whole plane actually move and the straw and the the sticks actually held up the plane so it could fly and the strings the string actually held up the whole plane
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_004_comb well we spinned the propeller like twenty-five times and we added two paper clips each time to see how far it went with more paper clips a i am not sure since we have not learned much about this we will probably make either a graph or we will probably make a chart
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_009_comb all we did so far is we did the predictions and the questions and she has not described all the parts so we are not really sure well the rubber band takes winds and when you wind it up it twists the rubber band so when you let go it makes it it actually makes the propeller go faster so it gives it up speed
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_024_comb well we could instead of a cork we could like use a ball of tin foil like mister suggested or we could use something heavier and that might affect how far it goes well we are going to put a cork and then we are going to launch it at different heights and see how far it will go
myst_996436_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_014_comb well the popsicle stick helps it holds up the propeller and the straws hold up the whole plane and those kind of form the body of the plane and the propeller helps move the plane yeah we will probably try out and launch those tommorow
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_020_comb well the more the less passengers you have the longer the distance will be and the more passengers you have it will not go as far wow we it was interesting how much the paper clips affected the plane
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_024_comb well one time we the paper clips it tipped over the plane and it kind a the string broke because there was too many paper clips on so we had to figure out why it was breaking and we kind of realized it was on the wrong place and that affects it well it would not be exactly or you can figure out if that thing made it worse or
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_029_comb well i think that if you had three passengers it well actually one passenger would go a little farther since it was not that it does not have that much impact of how the weight is of the of the plane
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_025_comb well first we tried the putting it where the stick was instead of where the straw was but we kind of could tell it kind of interfered how it went kind of the paper clip kind of swung hit the string so we asked our teacher and then we s noticed that it was wrong well it depends if you add too many passengers it will it will make the
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_008_comb we added t well you added too many paper clips at a time then you took t too many out of it too many off well if we did more winds it might make it go a little farther but not that far because of the pressure of the paper clips
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_027_comb when the when the well winds is like how fast it goes and number of passengers it is the more passengers you have the the shorter the distance is so if you have like ten passengers it might not go as far as it will with one passenger
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_013_comb well we figured out the more paper clips it has the s the the slower it goes and it does not go as long it better and you could only change you would only change one at a time because if you change too many you would not know if that one of em out of that would make it better and the other one just made it worse yes because
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_017_comb well with the two blue straws hold up the pap the pa the popsicle sticks so that we hold the propeller in the two endings and we put the rubber band on so we twist the rubber band and it makes the propeller wind well we added two every time so two thousand, four hundred and sixty-eight so we could see how much it the difference would be between how much we put on
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_023_comb how far it will go we have been we have been putting two passengers at a time and then seeing how far it will go with twenty-five winds and then we add two more and then see how far that will go and we keep adding until we get to ten well we we added two paper clips each time that affected how the distance how far it was
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_019_comb well we do not test the sticks and we do not test the the the string exactly because the popsicle stick is just kind of it is like the body of it and the string just helps hold it up well we changed it to see if we got it right that time or if it made that worse or make it better
myst_996436_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.3_035_comb well if like you take off one of the of the straws it might affect the plane it will make the plane go slower and it will not go as far well the more you add the the more rubberbands you add are motors that goes farther so if you add ten
myst_996436_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_008_comb well that so we could tell which the difference is and it will be easier to explain well you can well we if like we added an extra paperclip and then and it slowed down even more and the people are in excess added like a bunch of rubberbands and it did a flip but it did not go as far
myst_996436_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_016_comb well you place the y there because it is on the line of the and then it will be it will be like right there so you it is easier we have been making pa we have been making planes and testing them and seeing we have been changing some variables and seeing what it would do so you can
myst_996436_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_003_comb we were doing graphing and the we did that the more paperclips we have the less the less farther it goes well we listed the numbers of passengers and the distance and we realized that the more passengers you have the it does not go as far
myst_996436_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_020_comb well we could change like how many rubberbands we had or put on some extra passengers or me and my partner made wings well it is goes up because the more you the more you motors you have or pennies you have it will be like it goes farther up
myst_996436_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_013_comb that the more you have the higher the number gets in the y and the x gets higher too but the the y gets pretty high so that means that like you are adding a lot of this at a time well usually it does not matter but you have to like list like the number of passengers and the distance and it does not exactly matter what side you put it on though
myst_996436_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_019_comb well if you like add two paperclips and it makes it go less than it will like have like from like it is well i am not sure
myst_996436_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_014_comb they are and x and the y are matched up so they are pretty much the same well the more you add the passengers the distance will it it will not go as far
myst_996436_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_007_comb the number of the numbers that it goes up to the number of passengers and the distance and how far that goes up to well x is number of motors or rubberbands and y is the distance we have been making paper boats and seeing the capacity and how much passengers they can hold and we have been doing graphs
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_015_comb well we knew that there is one a few that had wax on the outside and that those may be able to hold more water because their might be stronger than the paper cups and that the capacity would be like if wait
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_005_comb we did four different sizes of boats so we could tell which so if we did all four the same we would not know if different sizes could hold more or less it shows you what where the where the the capacity and the passengers meet up on the graph
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_007_comb if you change one variable then the other if it works better or less then you do not have to change the other variable so you only ch so change one at a time well we put down how much capacity until we get to the highest number and how much the passengers until we got it is how capacity is how much water it can hold
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_012_comb well how how big the boat is and how tall it is affects how much passengers it can hold the higher it gets the more passengers it gets and more capacity it can get well the you can you can find that maybe one it like one boat can hold more passengers th and one can hold less but it depends on the size
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_011_comb well they are putting em in the middle so it can hold more but if you put em all to the side it will tip over with less amount in pennies than it actually can hold what we did here is we we found one
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_009_comb well first well we put the how much capacity the boats could hold and then how much passengers it can ho it can hold and if you put the passengers in the middle you might be able to hold more but if they are on the side then you could pro if they are all s on the side it will probably tip over sooner
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_020_comb well on the bottom of the graph is how much the number of passenger no yeah is the number of passengers that it can that as the capacity gets higher so does the number of passengers that the more capacity it can hold the more passengers
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_017_comb well it depends of the size of the boat how much it can hold and how much you would be able to estimate how much you can it could hold if you change too many at one time then you will not know if you got it right at the beginning or that you had too many change or you had just right amount of change
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_013_comb how much how they put the pennies in they stacked them in the in the middle instead of putting them all to one side or just putting them all over the place and they they set them in instead of dropping them the different size of the cup depends how much capacity it can hold and how many passengers it can hold
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_026_comb it can hold too and that if the capacity is wh th when the capacity is kinda lower when the capacity is lower the number of passengers is lower always lower than the how much the capacity can hold
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_024_comb well you would take you would lessen either by 10s or by 2s or anything like that and then you would connect them like how many passengers it could hold you could like go two thousand, four hundred and sixty-eight and ten on each way and then you connect them and it should have gone up the graph instead of going down well we did four different sizes so that we could tell which one could hold more and which one could hold less
myst_996436_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_010_comb well the s smaller the boat is the less passengers it can hold we were in charge of seeing how much capacity it can hold and how much pennies we can hold and we did four different sizes of boats so we could see what the difference was we we made four boats out of paper cups and we had to make it between one centimeter and four centimeters
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_018_comb if they are smaller then it will be harder to put more pennies in and if they are bigger it will be easier since they are taller and you can put more pennies in without it sinking you are only stacking on one side and if you stack em on one side it is going to sink if you stack em in the middle like the one on the left it will stay up longer at one time you could
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_007_comb it was important to make sure there is different sizes and if they were not different sizes they would just carry the same amount of water and pennies i can not i am not sure with string and then the other one is supposed to be eight too but if you do one that is accidentally nine it will end up being a little different
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_028_comb cause it depends how you put the pennies in if you kind of drop em in they might be less if you set em in it might be easier if you put em on one side it might be harder to do that and if you stack em evenly it might have more there we designed them to hold pennies and to hold a certain amount of water and to see how much water they could hold
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_013_comb that if you stack em it will stay evenly and that it could hold more and if you just kind of put them all over the place it does not really work that well without sinking the smaller ones might not as hold as much pennies because they are not as taller and it will overflow faster
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_049_comb the one that is under water has too many pennies because they are all piled up and they are spread out but the one that is still above is even and it will be easier to see which one would work better if the smaller one or the medium sized one or the bigger one and so we could just choose different kinds and see what the results are for different ones
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_020_comb once the boat sunk you took one penny out and then counted how many pennies you have left and see that is how many passengers your boat can hold if you change too many well if if you do not get it the same measurement then someone if you are like doing a pendulum like last year well last week if you do a shorter length or a longer length you might end up with a different amount of swings
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_009_comb how much how tall the boat was and how wide it was that the difference if they are wider or taller they will will hold more water and more pennies that the smaller one might hold less amount of pennies and then the medium will hold a little more and a little more and a little more like you could have if you added too many things you
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_019_comb if the water is like ha it is really tall waves it will knock em over but if it is calm and kind of flat and just sitting there then it will be easier to stack them if the boat is smaller it will be harder to put the pennies in since if it had more pressure and weight on it and it is not as tall and it will sink with more less pennies cause if they were the same then you do not even know if you know other kinds would work better or work less
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_026_comb okay i am not sure on this one if you only change one thing at a time it might be easier to see if that thing made it worse or better this week in science we have been working on the capacity of boats with little paper cups and we have been seeing how much water they can hold and how much pennies they can hold if you put them in the middle they will be able to have more since it is balanced and if you put them kinda everywhere it will sink faster
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_021_comb when the boat you should stop there because if you put any more in you will probably overflow the boat if you like put them on one side it would sink over if you balance em it might ha be able to hold more if you do not use accurate measurements then it could let us say you do one that is eight centi if you set them down it might be easier to put more in if you kind a just drop em in it might you know make it sink
myst_996436_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_044_comb if you only change if you change one variable at a time it will be easier to see if you are doing it right or wrong the straws tried to h to hold up the string and the popsicle sticks we narrowed it down so it would fit in to those little things that hold the rubber band and their propeller and that is how it works
myst_996436_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_005_comb we used popsicle sticks and a propeller and straws and then were we were spinning the propeller twenty-five times to see it how far it could get down the string peller up so we could se and making planes with straws on a propeller and we took the string and tied it to two chairs and wind up the propeller and see how far it could get effects how much it can fly
myst_996436_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_014_comb we could see how it could when we spin it how far it could go well i think you maybe that it might be more helpful if you change the how many times you wind up the propeller and what kind of straws you use and what kind of string and if the string is at an angle
myst_996436_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_022_comb well the one on the bottom is not as straight as the one on top up and i think that if the one on the top is straighter it will be easier for it to fly but at the one at an angle it might be harder for well me and my partner we put our string at an angle and we learned that if you put it at an angle it body of it and then you have something that holds it up and makes it fly
myst_996436_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_009_comb they they held up the propeller and it helped to spin it and it kept it from falling down and it helped a lot is that you you have the propeller and something that holds the propeller up and then you have
myst_996436_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_023_comb well if it is exactly the same level and it is tight and it is not loose then it might be able to fly easier and more smooth but if it is loose and it is kind a has a dip then it might be harder for it to get up
myst_996436_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_010_comb we used different we used different materials and we used craft sticks and we had to narrow it down with sandpaper and we cut the straws in half and punched holes through em and then we stick the other straw through em and put it on the string and then twisted the propeller and see how far it could get what is important is the body the propeller and what the string and what is holding it up
myst_996436_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_019_comb well you need to think about how far you should spread apart your straws and what kind of string you should use and how many times you wind up the propeller if the water is too rough the boat could tip over but if it is calm it will be easier to put the pennies and it will stay up capacity is how much water it can hold and if the smaller ones do not hold as much water and pennies but the taller ones and the bigger ones hold more
myst_996436_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_023_comb size is com matter what how much water it can hold the size is you know kind a determine what how much water it can hold how wide and how tall the boat is we made four paper boats and see how many how much water they can hold and how much pennies it can hold
myst_996436_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_014_comb if you put em all over the place then it will not stay up that hard far and it will just sink but if you put them like in the middle and stack em you can fit more pennies better and hold more if you made them all the same you would not know if you made em a smaller or bigger size that they could hold more or less we are going to s we s see how many capacity it can hold and how many pennies they could hold
myst_996436_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_011_comb f you drop them in it might not hold as much but if you set em in and you keep them even it will hold more let us see if you drop the pennies in you can have less you will probably have less and if you stack em on one side you can have more but if you stack em on the edge it will tip over and you could have less if they are smaller they will not hold as much and if they are bigger they will hold more if you put em all on one side it will sink but if you put it in the middle they will stay even and you can hold more pennies
myst_996436_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_019_comb we put the wa to hold pennies and see how much water it could hold we made four different sizes to see which one would if you put it on the side it will sink and if you put it in the middle you can hold more pennies we taped a pencil to our desk and then we let it swing back and forth and see how much how many times it swing it swings back and forth in twelve seconds they both have a penny at the end
myst_996436_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_014_comb if you changed too many variables at once then you might not know if you changed too many and it might not work a few days ago we flew paper airplanes we made a penny with so it went back and forth like a pendulum the shorter it gets the fa the more swings it does it takes
myst_996436_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_020_comb it is like the other one the shorter the string is then the higher the amount of swings are let us see the bigger the longer ones take longer to go back and forth so it is not as much as it is a shorter one how many times the pendulum swings back and forth i do not know since it is smaller it goes faster actually the bigger it gets the more swings it has they are not all the same they are a little different a little different way
myst_996436_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_013_comb if it is shorter it will go fast slower this one is longer that the others and you only should change one variable at a time cause if you changed too many things at one time it you do not know if you have changed too many things
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_013_comb we put the lid on one plastic cup because it could not evaporate and escape we left the other one open because we wanted to see what happened and compare the two cups
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_011_comb i observed that over time the li the cup with the covered lid became heavier because the water in the uncovered cup evaporated out well the one with the covered cup the water stayed in
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_012_comb we could slow down evaporation by either putting water in a cold container which would stop water droplets from being formed and rising or we could seal the container so it could not escape
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_015_comb water as a gas is the lightest of the three states of water this is because the molecules are very far apart from each other causing you to be able to move through it without any notion of it being there
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_005_comb the water when it is heated turns into tiny droplets which are rise into the air and condense where they can form a cloud and precipitate it means that the water has or whatever other liquid has evaporated off the surface
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_018_comb water in the air can have many shapes this is because it has nothing to hold it in if it is poured into a container or a container is filled with it and sealed it will take the shape of the container i would describe it as water vapor or tiny droplets of water that are very far apart
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_014_comb water that evaporates forms into water vapor which is a cloud of very tiny water droplets that are far apart this water vapor can condense into larger drops and fall from the sky which is known as precipitation
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_004_comb the water is evaporating off the surface causing the amount of water to shrink
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_016_comb a lot of times when water is a gas and is warm this is what you see as steam when something is boiling water vapor also can be cold because it is high up in the atmosphere and is condensing
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_006_comb the water is evaporating over the course of time if it is left for only fifteen minutes the small amount of water will evaporate if it is left for thirty minutes more water will evaporate if it is left for forty-five minutes almost all of the water will evaporate and if it is left for an hour all of the water will evaporate
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_008_comb evaporation is the process of a liquid turning to a gas sometimes a solid can turn straight to a gas if it is put under high temperatures
myst_990507_2010-08-02_00-00-00_WA_3.1_017_comb it looks like a thin gray mist although when in very large portions it looks like a white cloud which is actually what it is we have been studying how ice expands when it is frozen well water expands i found out that they are less dense than the water
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_021_comb the hot water floated because it was less dense than water at room temperature this we could see only because of food coloring we added to the water
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_014_comb we put hot water and a a glass vial and lowered it into the water the red food colored hot water came out of the top proving that hot water is less dense than room temperature water
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_017_comb i noticed that the hot water went into the top of the water in the glass immediately forming a cloud that we could see because of the food coloring however when you let it sit and the temperature is changed the red food coloring dispersed
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_016_comb the red water is rising to the top this is because it is hot and less dense than the room temperature water which is the water in the middle and bottom of the glass
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_018_comb i noticed that hot water came out of the vial and immediately rose towards the top forming a red cloud that you could see because of the food coloring they are sitting on the bottom of the cup because they are more dense than water
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_022_comb here the cold water in the vial is staying in the vial because it is more dense than the room temperature water that surrounds it it is trying to sink the bottom of the vial is causing it to be stopped
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_007_comb these objects are floaters because they float this is because they are less dense than the water an example the cork has lots of air space causing it to float the same thing with the rubber stopper and the wooden ball
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_006_comb the cork stopper and the wooden ball are floating on the surface of the water this is because they are much less dense than the water if they were more dense it would be like the stone the paper clip and penny and would have sunk
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_003_comb we put these objects in the container of water the rubber stopper and the penny sunk objects in the bottom of the cup are more dense than water so they sink this is because they have no air space and displace m more water than they weigh
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_004_comb the cork the rubber stopper and the ball are floating in the container of water to the left this is because they are they are less dense than water in the container to the right the penny the stone and the paper clip are sinking because they are more dense than the water
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_020_comb the density wil of the cork relates to the density of the hot water because the hot water was less than still water causing it to f rise to the top and the cork was less dense than water causing it to rise to the top or float
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_005_comb the objects on top of the water are floating cause they are less dense than water this usually means that they have air space in them or they displace m less water than their weight
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_015_comb i observed that the water came out the top like a volcano forming clouds at the top of the vi of the cup of water
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_023_comb cold water is more dense than room temperature water the same thing with the stone the paper clip and the penny this causes it to sink to the bottom but it cannot sink because the bottom of the vial is blocking it
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_010_comb it means that an object has air space or displaces less water than it weighs this is why they float on the surface
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_002_comb we have been putting things in water to see if they float or sink things that float are less dense than water things that sink are more dense than water the cork is less dense than water i can tell this because it floats on top of the water it is going good it told me that it was less dense than water
myst_990507_2010-03-02_00-00-00_WA_2.2_024_comb cold water is more dense than room temperature water causing it to sink it cannot sink to the bottom because the bottom of the vial is blocking it it tells me that it is more dense than water also if something is the same density of the water it will hang suspended between the surface and the bottom
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_002_comb we have filled cups with water and put them in different places around the room such as on the window sill in the refrigerator by a computer and in the ceiling
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_009_comb i think that places with warm temperatures will make water evaporate more quickly well places with cool temperatures will make water evaporate slowly
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_021_comb when it is windy much more water is lost than when it is just in a plain room if it was in front of an even stronger fan i think it would lose more water than in front of the regular fan
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_014_comb a desert is very hot but very dry a jungle is also very hot but is very humid this is when there is a lot of water vapor in the air
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_020_comb i observe that after time the wind from the fan caused water to evaporate quickly no i do not remember the temperature
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_018_comb there is a lot less evaporation in the jungle than in the desert in fact only about a quarter of the water in the jungle cup was lost well about three quarters of the water in the desert cup was lost i think that warm places will have
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_007_comb it tells me that location d is the coldest location d i mean c is the second coldest location a is the second warmest and location b is the warmest
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_010_comb i think that warm temperatures make water evaporate quickly because when the water is heated its molecules move quickly causing it to spread out and turn into a gas
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_003_comb we took the air temperature and put them in the places where they were supposed to go every morning and every afternoon for four days we will check the air temperature and see how much water has evaporated
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_013_comb when the air is full of moisture water can evaporate quickly because there are is more water vapor in the air also as i said earlier water vapor tends to occur near warm places
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_016_comb i see that the temperature is the same in the jungle as in the desert but in the desert more water evaporated and in the jungle less water evaporated
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_012_comb the temperatures in cup c and d are the lowest but they have also lost the least amount of water
myst_990507_2010-06-02_00-00-00_WA_3.2_011_comb evaporation at low temperatures takes much longer because one the water can freeze and stop evaporation altogether unless heated quickly and two the water molecules are not moving as quickly which means it takes longer for them to spread out and turn into a gas
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_027_comb the water evaporated from the cup full of water is trapped inside the cup this means it has no place to go it still rises but when it touches the cool surface of the lid it condenses into tiny droplets
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_018_comb water vapor in the air condensates on the edge and outside of whatever is colder than the air it turns into beads of water that are usually spread far apart or are very by and form almost a fog like surface on the edge of the cup
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_015_comb these two cups are different temperatures the one with ice in it is cold the one that is green is room temperature when water vapor meets a cool surface it condensates on the surface this is why there are tiny droplets of water on the outside of the blue cold cup
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_012_comb i would describe water before it evaporates as a liquid and a liquid that when spread on to a flat surface spreads out into large seas that ha are not continuous the water on the table is evaporating
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_025_comb water evaporated from the water in the cup is turning to water vapor but when it touches the cold surface of the top of the cup it is turning to droplets and staying there therefore condensing the water it is in a gas state
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_029_comb it comes from the water sitting in the bottom of the cup
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_030_comb the sunlight traveling down onto the landscape will evaporate some of the water in the river and ocean this will condensate in the air once it has risen and form clouds which will rain go
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_020_comb that means that the blue cup is colder than the green cup and colder than the surrounding air before you put the ice in there is no condensation after you put the ice in and it is very cold there is lots of condensation because the water vapor is turning to liquid since it is so cold on the ed outside of the cup
myst_990507_2010-16-02_00-00-00_WA_3.4_017_comb the temperature of the cup where you see water droplets is closer to fifty or forty when you pour onto an earth material it will sometimes drain through quickly sometimes be partially absorbed but partially drip through and sometimes will be completely absorbed
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_018_comb i would use soil that absorbed a lot of the water that fell into it but did not turn to mud because if it turned to mud it would be hard for the plant to s stand up and grow but if there was a lot of water in it but it was not mud then they could grow well and in our dry climate even though they needed lots of water
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_004_comb i know that gravel does not fit together very well and is very hard i know that soil has a bunch of tiny pieces that fit together well and can absorb water because it is a spongy material with lots of places for water to go and soak in
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_016_comb from the information in this table if i get a one hundred milliliter rain and i have a gravel lawn then i can tell what is going to drain through or not so i can plan to see if my basement will be flooded or not
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_013_comb i could tell because even though there was less gravel they are equal weights and we poured the same amount of water into each that is why how i can tell that that soil absorbed more water
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_017_comb when we added water to gravel it quickly drained or evaporated in fact we felt both the soil and the gravel after a little while and the soil was still wet in some places well the gravel was almost completely dry
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_002_comb we put water in two cups that one that had soil and one that had gravel the cups had holes in them and they dripped into larger cups
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_006_comb when we added water to gravel it seeped through quickly and dripped very rapidly through the bottom of the cup this caused there to be a lot of water in the bottom of the cup the amount of water that drained through the gravel is forty milliliters this is five milliliters more than what soaked through the soil
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_010_comb when we added water to the soil the soil immediately became wet and soggy like mud then the soil started dripping and dried out fairly quickly the rocks did not absorb any water and therefore dripped through almost immediately
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_011_comb the water in the gravel cup has drained through quickly and has drained through more than the water in the soil cup also if there was a graph i believe that the soil would have taken longer to drip the thirty-five milliliters than the gravel took to drip the forty milliliters
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_008_comb it compares closely but still has a lot more water because you poured fifty milliliters into each one hundred and eighty of that drained through the rocks well only around seventy-five drained through the g soil
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_012_comb the water that does not come through the soil either is completely absorbed and then evaporates or evaporates because the soil is saturated and it cannot be s soaked in the the soil i see two equal piles of dirt or soil and rocks or gravel
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_014_comb the soil is much heavier than the gravel because it soaked up that water and is still contained in the soil that is what happened to the water that did not evaporate and the gravel all the water either s went through or evaporated immediately
myst_990507_2010-14-02_00-00-00_WA_4.1_005_comb we could find materials like soil in many places such as a home garden or on open fields in plains we can find lots of gravel on mountain sides or in deserts
myst_990507_2010-04-02_00-00-00_WA_2.3_003_comb when you cool water it actually contracts but when it reaches around thirty-eight degrees fahrenheit it actually expands and as it gets colder expands more and more
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_018_comb the shaft is what turns when the water wheel is spinning there are actually two separate shafts one is a dowel and one is a straw the water wheel turns the straw which is tied on to the dowel so the dowel turns which and able to lift things
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_020_comb thank you very much marnie bye see you next year or later this year it tells me that a water wheel can lift heavy weights with only a small amount of energy if we had added a pulley system it would have been even more efficient but would have taken longer to lift the object
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_011_comb it tells me that water wheels can lift heavy objects with only a little amount of force we can do this because we used a sh syringe to push the blades of the water wheel
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_009_comb we lifted things with a we are looking at how much water it took to lift a small item and a big item it took more water to lift a larger item and less water to lift a smaller item marnie you have already asked me that question
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_006_comb this picture is a mill that is using water to turn a water wheel that will move grindstones to turn wheat into flour he the miller sells the flour therefore earns his money
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_017_comb the water wheel in class did a much similar thing to this water wheel the energy from the water being poured the kinetic energy is pushing the water wheel which converts that energy into a pulling energy that hoist the paper clip
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_016_comb the string and paper clip are being hoisted up because the water wheel is turning moving water is often found in rivers and in waterfalls it can also be found in geysers or in ocean currents deep beneath the surface or at the surface
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_014_comb when the water pushes on the blades of the water wheel it the water wheel spins and can lift objects if they are cranked around the dowel or straw this is how we lifted objects off the floor
myst_990507_2010-18-02_00-00-00_WA_4.2_003_comb we made a water wheel to help us lift a paper clip the water on the surface is touching the air if water is touching the air it evaporates quicker the more water touching the air the faster something will evaporate
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_018_comb yes i have seen puddles of water evaporate when it rains we have unsloped sidewalk in the front of our house and there are a lots of puddles on it sometimes i used to go out and play in them then when i came out from doing something inside mo mo most of them were gone
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_003_comb we have been studying how surface area affects how much water in a cup evaporates
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_020_comb usually in the sunshine it is warm very warm when things are warm such as water their molecules move quickly and take up more space this causes droplets of water to expand and can turn into a gas if they expand the right amount
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_019_comb yes i think puddles evaporate quite a lot more in the sunshine true some lakes are very deep but they do have a very large surface area in fact usually the deeper you get on something the larger the surface area is
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_021_comb yes lots of other things about evaporation other than surface area surface area effects evaporation as we know heat eff effects evaporation and humidity effects evaporation
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_016_comb yes i can when you see a lake usually it has a lot of surface area but is not very deep when you see something like a well then it has little surface area but is very deep no nothing has surprised me quite yet
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_006_comb it went mean that container d would evaporate faster than all the other containers the water on the surface is exposed to the air
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_008_comb container d lost one hundred milliliters of water they all had the same amount of water in them and they all lost half the milliliters of the square centimeters that the area was for the top
myst_990507_2010-10-02_00-00-00_WA_3.3_010_comb i found out that d has the most surface a a has the least surface area b has the second most surface area and c has the second least surface area the air around it gets polluted i see a flame important because we need it
myst_004032_2013-12-03_10-25-46_EE_1.4_018_comb i think that the girl is getting energy from the apple she is eating to walk they are both non renewable air gets the air gets polluted i see some apples a jar a candle some wood and i don t know with the other thing is i think that stuff will move
myst_004032_2013-12-03_10-25-46_EE_1.4_003_comb i see a candle burning i see that the was the wax is melting think that the light is important she is eating and walking i see that the wax is melting i see that the wax is melting i can hear it and
myst_004032_2013-12-03_10-25-46_EE_1.4_019_comb the evidence is that she is she has energy to walk it s is melting the wax coal and gas would pollute the air i think that there the air will be polluted i do not know it turns into an electromagnet you can pick up metals
myst_004032_2014-02-10_14-11-01_EE_4.1_031_comb you have to have some electricity to make an electromagnet it just starts i do not know the wires have to go around the rivet it means that it can pick up stuff the steel rivet can pick up many washers it is closed i told to you a one billion times
myst_004032_2014-02-10_14-11-01_EE_4.1_015_comb there s lots of energy going through it electric electricity and a steel rivet make an electromagnet
myst_004032_2014-02-10_14-11-01_EE_4.1_005_comb the switch is connected the d cell and then the other side of the switch is wrapped around the rivet and the other side of the d cell is also wrapped around the rivet and then like most switch is down and the steel rivet is picking up the washers
myst_004032_2014-02-10_14-11-01_EE_4.1_008_comb it will ah i do not know because the wire is wrapped around the rivet electricity has to go around a steel ring and it can pick up stuff
myst_004032_2014-02-10_14-11-01_EE_4.1_025_comb if switch is opened then the steel the magnet can t pick up anything but if the switch is open then then electricity can flow
myst_004032_2014-02-10_14-11-01_EE_4.1_022_comb it is closed there are some objects they have to run lots of energy is going through the steel rivet we ve been seeing how rivet can pick up washer that means sometimes it can pick up stuff but sometimes it can t
myst_004032_2014-02-10_14-11-01_EE_4.1_028_comb when the switch is opened then no washers are on the magnet but when that is closed then other washers are the has to be made from steel just roll around the steel rivet then it can be a magnet
myst_004032_2014-02-10_14-11-01_EE_4.1_024_comb the flow of electricity is control by the switch because the switch is opened that you can the electricity cant flow when the switch is open the magnet can pick up any washers it turns into a magnet i am good how are you we tested it
myst_004032_2014-01-28_08-20-46_EE_3.3_023_comb i do not know they are pretty strong magnets so they just stick together the nail is not magnet anymore i don t know the magnet is sticking to the steel nail and that makes the steel nail a magnet
myst_004032_2014-01-28_08-20-46_EE_3.3_004_comb i did not hear what you just said it only stays as a magnet for a short time because if you take the magnet off the steel nail is not a magnet any the nail makes the the magnet makes the nail a temporary magnet
myst_004032_2014-01-28_08-20-46_EE_3.3_009_comb sometimes if the thing is too thick then the magnets won t be able to work through that thing i really do not know please tell
myst_004032_2014-01-28_08-20-46_EE_3.3_006_comb they are moving together because they stick to each other and one magnet is moving so the other just comes on i do not know we have been learning about magnets and what they attract to i don t know there are two batteries in both of them the top right
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_039_comb i think that it will become brighter i think that the bulbs will be very very very beautiful and bright and you are the beautiful the most beautiful lady in the world i told you a one billion to one trillion about one billion times there are two pathways
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_060_comb the series circuit the top ones are brighter than the bottom ones because it has to share the pathway we ve been learning about series and parallel circuits parallel circuits are brighter you are the deafest women the series circuit is dimmer
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_046_comb it is going in through the and out through the negative they have their own pathway what did you say there are two batteries i do not here so please say it again they are like the flow of electricity
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_009_comb i think that the bulb will be brighter i noticed that there are two pathways there are two path ways in a parallel circuit they have to share a pathway and a d cell
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_004_comb the parallel circuits there it s shorter and the light are brighter here comes the most beautifully lady
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_011_comb it s always going through one direction and it s going into the and out through the negative they do not have a direct pathway there are two there are two whole pathways and they are done
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_038_comb we ve been working with series and parallel circuits i ve told you like a one billion times you are the most ugliest women in the i think that we need to make sure that the light is bright so we need a parallel circuit it burns out very quickly it is flowing
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_017_comb there are two pathways there are two lights in there what did you say the one on the bottom left is burning out quickly the flow is going in through the and out through the negative i told you it goes out through the negative
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_024_comb because they have to share evenly with both of them and it doesn t go directly and it only goes to one lightbulb the direction it is going in through the and out through the negative side and it turns green they are brighter
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_036_comb they are all or they have their own pathway i noticed that it goes in through the and out through the negative you re the most ugliest woman i think that the best would be the series circuit of course or the parallel circuit of course
myst_004032_2013-12-17_09-32-54_EE_2.2_003_comb there are two lights and one battery and the light are bright i think that top right this these are wires
myst_004032_2013-11-18_09-23-37_EE_1.1_032_comb the positive side the wire that is touching the positive side is also touching the bulb base and the wire that is touching the negative side of the d cell is touching the bulb casing i notice that it turned around and the electricity is still flowing toward into the positive side and out the negative side
myst_004032_2013-11-18_09-23-37_EE_1.1_029_comb the the flow goes the other way the the positive side the wire that is touching the positive side is also touching the bulb base and the wire that is touching the negative side is also touching the bulb casing

myst_007004_2014-04-04_11-15-25_EE_3.1_023_comb it is made out of it s pri pri has like metal in the outside but steel are like iron in inside because the wood block is made out wood in this steel nail was a is well it is stick to iron steel and metal if it has steel or iron in it
myst_007004_2014-04-04_11-15-25_EE_3.1_003_comb well we have been messing with some magnets and paper bags outside to see if their work if we found little products in grass then they want to get stuck to the magnet the magnets picking up the steel nail but not the iron nail because it is repelling thing
myst_007004_2014-04-04_11-15-25_EE_3.1_015_comb well some refrigerators i think are made out of steel so and the nail is made of steel
myst_007004_2014-04-04_11-15-25_EE_3.1_010_comb the nail is sticking to the magnet is because it is a made of steel or iron or even or possibly metal that the reason is in is not sticking to wood is because wood is a made as steel or iron or metal it is the wood block is made paper cli one side was
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_012_comb i actually learned that from mother and father because i did not learn any th i have not learned that that much about grams from my teacher because well we a a gram is just about as much as a paper clip
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_006_comb no we no she ju no the teacher just she held up a little thing and said this is this is a gram is what you use to do weight this is this is about equal in weight to a gram and but then we did not have any more time milligram is a s one thousandth of a gram with a one thousandth of a gram
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_062_comb like having it on there
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_088_comb ten hey hi hi hi hi try to get that thing what was surprising
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_042_comb five and this is one hundred and five grams and this equals ten grams or fi twenty-five grams and twenty equals this is more like math but twenty equals 210s equals five equals 45s equals 21s that there is a one hundred grams there one side was the
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_010_comb a gram is about as much as a paper clip just weighs as much i mean that the net one of the beans equals a gram yeah let us see i want to see the tips i want to s look at the tips what does i mean
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_114_comb actually i weighed it with my table weighed it with jumbo paper clips some other ones weighed it with regular sa some other tables weighed it with regular sized paper clips okay we we can add more of that stuff
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018_comb and also i like x and i have also heard exograms my mother and father told me about that and also each side would weigh the same and it would be one line milligram weighs as much as i do not know maybe a grain of sugar or a grain of salt maybe i do not know i do not really i am not sure but and we did weigh it with paper clips
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_080_comb we would add one hundred if it was not enough we had to more like that one all of those things went in and the orange weighed more okay but i want to see the interactive chips and but he thought it was sixty-two milligrams and he thought that it it was monster
myst_996220_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_004_comb i have been well i did not know i think but on friday we we just heard about a gram we just heard about a gram like on friday we have not used with those things yet the teacher has only shown us we did the vial thing and then the teacher also showed us but
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_078_comb zero those things push out the water and it is wherever this little point is that is how much water is in there a milligram no a no no no not a milligr gram a centigram if there was ever such a thing as that a one hundredth of a gram hey can you make this bigger i think you i can we have to figure out a standard
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012_comb m my group got one hundred and five another group got two ano another group got one hundred and five and another group got two there was some vials this big and some vials were that big a l a little cup which was equal to one liter and a i am not i i know it not exactly like that hey was that the next one down i can what is that one
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_158_comb prob probably milliliters that we sort of did we came up with using the liter or the meter or the gram i know but what is f number four it said it was liquids the v volume of things that like in the i am th the thing about
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_054_comb okay but can but can you go can you click on that what was the weight of a liter a liter is weighs the same amount as a kilogram wow yeah yeah it is not just it is the height with depth and height and length height with debt and length well that tells you how much water it is
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_118_comb mass the length or width or height wha what is one milliliter spoo we did that one al we one milliliter spoon i am wait i need to look at the zero yeah we already did not miss that hey i think this is on backwards that is why it is keeps on falling off
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_018_comb it is so four vials equals one of those cups it thinks and the nine vials equals one of those nine of those those that we have to figure out a standard that is a one hundred that is a one thousandth of it that is a tenth and that is tenth of it and that is a whole of it
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_034_comb with milliliters and also these things those are each of those is a one hundred milliliters well like well because then some people say that it is this amount w of vials and some people say it is th a different amount before that looked like before sorry gr no not that one w did we do this one it is a one hundredth
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_108_comb that the only thing that we we again i forgot again where we were what does this mean but i want to see the that means a one hundred of those equals one of those those are li milliliters i think i will get it
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_068_comb you would find the cup that looked like that and you would pour it in yeah no let us s compare vials yeah that is like what ours were liters now can we look at this the volume it is the amount of it the amount of the stuff
myst_996220_2008-18-12_00-00-00_MS_3.2_044_comb you could s measure out a lot of water zero but i want to see the first i want to do not forget the a well we took a our s social studies and science journal thing and we started writing one meter equals no actually we did not do that
myst_996220_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_040_comb by to yeah because to be a nine hundred and tenth is al i mean two and nine tenths is almost three my favorite animal is a black dragon fish and i really like the ocean because a black dragon fish is a kind of fish that lives in the ocean and it is a deep sea s fish like especially like deep sea fish one hundred and ten millimeter equals one teeny centimeter
myst_996220_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_032_comb yeah i was blowing on mine a bit no we already had rulers but we did not use them we learned about the metric with meters and centimeters and all the oth and the rest of the world uses nope not at all because my desk seemed shorter than all the other ones at my table a meter is three point something feet yeah you might color it though i i have no idea we might color it sometime
myst_996220_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_036_comb by to it because like most people desks were three by two but mine was two and nine tenths by two i want to see what else is there i do not want to get no we just start we just started cutting it out and glued it together a centimeter is a one hundredth of a meter it is a one hundred and one meter going all the way
myst_996220_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_084_comb ten are in one hundred and ten millimeters are in one centimeter zero yeah we measured our desk with straws the last thing that we did with what we me we used th those vials we used those vials and we measured the amount of water in some cups in these cups and they had lu these markings on them they had these
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_012_comb yeah well not well sort of that is sort of like what we did last time that is two hundred milliliters but what what is it called is what i am wondering zero a tray the syringe is a is a thing that sorta sucks up water it is and then it tells you how much is in there that you sucked up yeah that was a long time ago that was before winter break
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_010_comb and we were not using vials we l used vials a long time ago zero that one is really well that one is the same as that so that one weighs the same as that other one the middle one that we saw before in that thing and that was two hundred
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_014_comb we got water out of first we got water out of cup marked c we got water out of cup marked c there was this cup and it had an a mark a b mark and a d mark and a c mark and then we used that thing which we had before it was those things which you suck up the water with
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_018_comb no no we have one cup and it has an a line a b line a c line a d line it is the only interactive one and you pull water out of the you pull the water out of the cup and into the syringe and then you squirt it back in and then measure the amount of water that was in the cup with the syringe
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_050_comb well because that is one is wide it is too flat and those two out it would be the same size as that well because we would not know if it was exactly two hundred milliliters milliliters are are thousandths of a liter they are thousandths of a liter
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_046_comb two hundred milliliter graduated cylinders equal what is that well we did the well we a well m well not really sort of we measured and made sure that but the this my group we got one of those but i did not know it was it was not a one hundred milliliter it was a fifty milliliter one
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_032_comb because the vials were different yeah s milliliters what was the soda can the interactive soda can i like the interactive ones aw maybe that is a wait but there is something a bit in inaccurate there they the it is not exactly because look see that thing is the same amount wide as that zero it might be l longer that way fifty most of are graduated cylinders but those ones have a one hundred
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_016_comb syringes yes you just ta i ju hey i just saw a syringe i just saw fifty and we also lews used fifty milliliter ones well m l stands stands for milliliters and then the number in front of it that is how many milliliters it is we what you do is you have to have you look at where the water is lined up and the one that the water is lined up to is the one that you are
myst_996220_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_4.1_078_comb but i want to look at the int that is the only interactive thing though then for those you just pour it in for those you pour some you put water in those yeah we used that thing i think really it is the last one i saw because one filament is breaking and the light bulb burnts out and then the other light bulb is not lighting
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_002_comb i have been learning about how a magnets how the electricity flows to magnets and the force of magnet i think that because one light bulb one filament is broken the other light bulb were not light i do not know
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_018_comb whenever whenever the filament breaks the other light bulb subsliding because they are both connected whenever one bulb burnts out the other one bulb burns out i have seen one where one is connected to a switch one is has their own wires and one share a wire
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_009_comb whenever you connect the switch to a light bulb you can not whenever you connect the switch to the metal pieces umm i don t know i think i do not know i think that each and everyone has their own wire zero so whenever one filament breaks the other one still light
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_015_comb i think there was series circuit is like this because the wires are connected to the switch and whenever i am click the switch it turns on to makes the light bulb turned on whenever the filament breaks that is when the both light bulbs stop working
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_030_comb it has to do the bulb burning out because the filament breaks and like whenever a filament breaks so light bulb will not like anymore whenever one light bulb burns out the other light bulb will not work whenever one bulb burns out the other one burns out
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_024_comb the other one is still lighting because each light bulb has their own light and own wire the electricity stops the energy stops flowing through the wires i do not know
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_013_comb whenever the middle light bulb burns out the flow of the electricity completely stops because all of the electricity flows through it the flow the electricity stops whenever the filament is broken so none of the light bulbs were lights
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_006_comb whenever i click on the switch the switch connects to the wire i mean to the metal things and then the light bulb turns on because because on the switch has it is metal so the electricity flows through it
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_016_comb i think that it whenever is the both that one breaks both of them power out because they are both connected and then they will not work it they are not connected any more i think the electricity stops flowing because one filament breaks in their connected so they will not work anymore think that all of them are connected because maybe all of the wires are together
myst_007096_2014-04-16_12-47-24_EE_2.3_028_comb i think that they are all connected because they are all connected to one battery whenever the whenever the filament breaks and the other one the other one is still lighting because they both have their separate their own separate wire i see that there are wires and the switches on connected but if you connect the switch so the light bulb will light the motor is not running because energy is not flowing through the wood
myst_007096_2014-02-24_11-56-36_EE_1.3_014_comb the wood stick i think its been insulated and its cannot create energy because its wood and wood cannot create a spark of energy or electricity i noticed that they re all metal and not like plastic rubber or anything like that i would describe it as closed may be
myst_007096_2014-02-24_11-56-36_EE_1.3_006_comb i have been learning that metal can makes the flags spin but other thigs that are not metal can t how are you the nails is making creating energy from the switch to makes the flags spin around you get to use the difference stuff to make the motor
myst_007096_2014-02-24_11-56-36_EE_1.3_012_comb i noticed that something what is like a popsicle stick and it won t work because it can t create wood can t create the spark of electricity there is a d cell wires a switch and a nail conductors or anything metal that can create create is spark of energy or electricity
myst_007096_2014-02-24_11-56-36_EE_1.3_010_comb if it s metal at work right if it s not metal it will not work like this rock it is not metal so it will not the paper clips is metal so it creates energy into the motor so you can make the flag spin electricity and energy i ve been working on hm circuits and different things to make the motors been around and around
myst_007096_2014-02-24_11-56-36_EE_1.3_017_comb what happens is like if you click on a metal thing like a paperclip it will spin but if you click on something like a rock it will not the motor does not spin because sponge is not metal so it can t create spark of energy or electricity
myst_007096_2014-02-24_11-56-36_EE_1.3_015_comb it s metal so it will work but if i click on the sponge it will it will not work because that is not metal
myst_007096_2014-03-20_13-14-10_EE_2.3_015_comb i m i think a series circuit is like that because may be because the wire is connected to the switch and the only way for the light bulb to light is because so on switched get on the metal whenever i click on a bulb ah one is the energy completely stops
myst_007096_2014-03-20_13-14-10_EE_2.3_001_comb i am doing good how are you i notice that whenever i click on a light bulb the filament breaks but the other light bulb is still lighting whatever one breaks the other one is the lighting because it has its owned wires i think that one filament is broken and then the other one isnt lighting because is the one is broke
myst_007096_2014-03-20_13-14-10_EE_2.3_026_comb i m i think that everyone every light bulb has its own energy i mean wired so that the other one and if one burns out the other one will still light the electricity stops flowing because the filament breaks and the one filament can not connects to the other filament to make a let energy flows
myst_007096_2014-03-20_13-14-10_EE_2.3_006_comb the switch turned to metal so it the light bulb is not lighting but if i clicked again the switch turned off and it is not like the i think what happen when bulb breaks is that the electricity doesn t flows through the light bulb the filament break one ah light bulb is burned out because of the filament broke so the other light bulb will not light
myst_007096_2014-03-20_13-14-10_EE_2.3_012_comb what happen when one light bulb goes out is the the light bulb that doesn t work and then the other light bulb is not lighting of work this picture has to do with the bulb burning up because one light bulb is burned out and the other light bulb is not working so that makes sense i think it relates to the last one i stop because one hm filament breaks and then its stops lighting and then they replace it with the new one and then light again
myst_007096_2014-03-20_13-14-10_EE_2.3_028_comb i think they re all connected in a parallel circuit because they each at they each all are connected to the light bulb i mean the battery sorry i m noticed that whenever one light bulb breaks the other ones still i know that the circuit is not the on the metal side so it the light bulb is not lighting
myst_007096_2014-03-20_13-14-10_EE_2.3_014_comb i think all of the circuits are connected because all of the wires are connected to one light bulb that may be i think that the ah one of the light bulbs burned out and then the other light bulbs get right because it won t they work i am learning about mar electricity completely stops
myst_007096_2014-03-20_13-14-10_EE_2.3_022_comb i think the picture is that one light one filament is broken so it doesn t work but the other one is working because it has its own wire i think that when ever filament breaks both these are light bulb turn on just because one light bulb and helps to other light bulb wire i think the blue dot represent the energy i ve been learning how do used stuff to light a light bulb
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_021_comb it because that is the minus sign and it heads towards so light bulb and then it comes out of the light bulb towards the plus i noticed that now it s now that is put around the energy is going to the other way because the energy is always goes out of the minus side and in always goes into the plus side i can tell you that that is the minus sign but that s really zero i get think of right now what did you have in mind
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_016_comb i see that it s the energy is starting from the d cell battery flowing up into the light bulb and then down back into the d cell battery to makes the light bulbs light i noticed that the battery needs like its turned around so that the energy can go out of the minus side and into the light bulb and then back into the plus sign
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_010_comb i think what travels in wires is energy took to make the light bulb light i think that it would it would i m make more energy so that it would showed up one edge and go faster maybe white bulbs are turned light over room or anything that needs light in darkness just like the sun i am great how are you
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_007_comb i mean that it helps them and it helps light a light bulb by i m using energy to the energy is staring from the and going up into the light bulb and coming out of the light bulb into the plus side
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_008_comb the wires are the wires i found i think the wires creates a spark and makes the light bulb light
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_014_comb i think the light i think the light bulb is a receiver because the d cell battery creates energy and reserve wires make it flow through and then the light bulb receive the energy to make it light they help they help light the light bulb
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_018_comb the the minus sign the minus the minus sign is the negative because that has a minus sign to make it go through and then the positive sign is the plus sign since so it make a comes through it so that it that means it s and negative that means minus sign is and the plus sign is positive maybe
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_027_comb i noticed that the light or the battery is turned around so that the energy can move it is from the light bulb but if i was turned around the other way the energy would go around the other way i think it s a source because i m it s a source to like a light bulb i think that the wires carry energy maybe
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_009_comb i think it means that and you you put it the wires on the battery and connected to the light bulb that it s like a pathway for energy into the light bulb i notice that if you stick among the edges they will work but if you stick among the bottom they would not work why is that possible
myst_007096_2014-02-04_13-09-30_EE_1.1_005_comb it s important to help no light bulb light because the battery is a really big to use it is flowing away from the minus side i have been learning about magnets
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-03-21_EE_2.3_011_comb whenever i click on the switch the switch touches the two metal things then the light bulbs turns on i think that whenever that happens just because the two wires are connected to the metal to the switch and then it is creating energy and then the energy can flow through the switch and then back into the wires to makes the light bulb light up i know that
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-03-21_EE_2.3_009_comb i know that if the switch is connected to the other two metal pieces that the light bulb would light up i have been learning about magnets i think that the series circuits i think it series circuit is like two light bulbs are have show the same wire and then whenever one light bulb burns out the other light bulb burns out
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-03-21_EE_2.3_013_comb i think a parallel circuit maybe whenever i whenever i have it string away it is and one light bulb burns out the the other light bulb will not work i know that strings of lights they
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-03-21_EE_2.3_010_comb i think the bulb is in that up because the switch is on the two metal pieces i think that the fridges either made of iron or steel if ordered for something to stick to a magnet it has to have iron or steel in it the nail and the refrigerator was stick to a magnet because it either has a metal steel or iron in it
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_019_comb steel or iron i think that all of the things that stick to the magnet or either made out of steel or iron there has to be a certain type of metal for it to stick to a magnets this bunch will not stick to magnet wood will not stick to magnets anything go living will not stick to magnets
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_005_comb magnets can attracts anything that is iron or steel magnets stick to anything steel metal will not every single metal but some metal and iron this steel one was stick because it has either steel or iron in it
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_004_comb magnets can stick to anything that is made of metal or steel no no they can also stick to iron the wood the steel nail will stick to the magnet because it is it has either iron or steel in it but the block will not because it does not have iron nor steel
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_023_comb i think that if you get a paper clip to stick it will because it is made of steel or iron steel or iron i think that the paper clip is attracted to the magnet because it is made of steel or iron they has to have iron or steel in it
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_012_comb the steel nail will stick to the magnet because it is made out of steel or iron and the wooden block will not because it is not made of the steel or iron
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_010_comb anything metal or steel works i mean anything metal steel or iron were not all metals do but most metals steel and all steel and all iron well more ever magnets have a magnetic force so they can pick up anything with iron in it i am doing pretty good i have been learning about magnets
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_027_comb magnets can stick to everything that is made out of steel or metal
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_020_comb the only thing that metal the only thing a magnet can stick to metal is that the metal has to have the metal has to have steel or iron in it
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_024_comb the paper clips sticks to the magnet because it is made out of steel or iron the aluminum nail does not stick because it is it does not have steel or iron in it but the steel nail does have steel or iron in it
myst_007096_2014-04-18_11-07-56_EE_3.1_011_comb the steel nail is attracted to the magnet because it is made out of it is made out of steel or iron and the block is not sticking to the magnet because it is does not have steel or iron i think the solar cell when it creates energy to makes the motor move so the flag will not spin
myst_007096_2014-02-12_10-10-50_EE_1.2_008_comb i m i think that the d cell is creating energy to makes them motor move and the wires are can connected to the motor to makes it move but the switch is not touching the other wires so the motor will not move
myst_007096_2014-02-12_10-10-50_EE_1.2_002_comb what i have been doing in science is create it making a motor run the electrical flow from the d cell battery stops whenever the sun is out it the sun might goes to the solar panel to and it creates energy through the wires and into the motor to make flag spin but if it is cloudy it can t do that stuff like i said
myst_007096_2014-02-12_10-10-50_EE_1.2_025_comb and the d cell creates energy and it flows to the wires into the motor to makes this flag i think is it s important because it doesn t waste energy and no it doesn t waste the d cell battery and may creates the energy to makes the motor move whenever switch is closed i noticed that the flag is moving good how are you
myst_007096_2014-02-12_10-10-50_EE_1.2_004_comb energy has to flow through the d cell into the wires and the motor receives it some light has to hit the i m solar panel i noticed that whenever i once the flag it touch the metal on the flag started moving whenever it like it began the flags stop moving why is that
myst_007096_2014-02-12_10-10-50_EE_1.2_014_comb the solar cells get power from the light whenever is the sun hits the cells it s creates energy to flow into when ever its flowing it energy is not happening in the the flag doesn t not move
myst_007096_2014-02-12_10-10-50_EE_1.2_021_comb whenever i click on the sign it makes like to makes the flag spin but whenever i click on the sign again it creates dark clouds so the motor the flag will not the battery helps like charging just like a
myst_007096_2014-02-12_10-10-50_EE_1.2_015_comb the sun is giving is giving light to the solar panel and it s on creating a energy so and it flows to the wires energy is going into the motor to make that flag spin
myst_007096_2014-02-12_10-10-50_EE_1.2_010_comb i think whenever is the switch was off then it creates spark but whenever the switch is on the other metal it creates a spark to make the flag move sun is giving the solar energy and it s flows to the wires into the motor to makes the flag spin i think that the switch has to be on the metal to makes the flag to move the create energy
myst_007096_2014-03-18_09-09-35_EE_2.2_008_comb i noticedthat there is energy flowing through all of them i actually think it if it has its own its own pathway it will light brightly i noticed that there is only eleven light bulb in the left and there is two light bulbs in the right but there re they both they re both the same are right now i think that the battery i mean the light bulb will dim
myst_007096_2014-03-18_09-09-35_EE_2.2_014_comb i think it is falling out of the negative side and backing to the positive side i observed that its possible going other positive side and then like they are like i don t i have been working on what stick to magnet i noticed that there is many pathways
myst_007096_2014-03-18_09-09-35_EE_2.2_004_comb i m a i see that there is a d cell four wires and then the wires are in the metal things to makes the light bulb light i remember that ah a closed that is the positive side and then back into the negative side i think that the top circuit will be because the top circuit so very bright
myst_007096_2014-03-18_09-09-35_EE_2.2_027_comb i think the top one would because it s they are brighter i think they compare with this circuit because i don t i don t know i think that it s going under the negative side into the battery i mean all of the battery at then into the other light bulb in back end to the battery
myst_007096_2014-03-18_09-09-35_EE_2.2_022_comb i think that the bottom one is so dim because one light bulb is getting bright form the other light bulb i notice that in one picture it has less wires and the other picture it has no wires i think that there are more path ways may be i really don t know
myst_007096_2014-03-18_09-09-35_EE_2.2_010_comb the lights would get dimmer i think that there re dimmer because one light one light bulb is getting energy from the other light bulb fantastic how are you electricity flows through all the metal into light bulb two d cells are brighter but one d cell is not very bright at all up to fresh in is that the goes up to the d cell and goes a back into the light bulb because that is how it work
myst_007096_2014-03-12_09-50-39_EE_2.1_014_comb flows out of the minus sign goes into that light bulb because light bulb and then goes back into the battery like a regular
myst_007096_2014-03-12_09-50-39_EE_2.1_010_comb the circuit goes is the d cell and then the energy goes through d cell and goes to the pathway which is the wires goes the energy goes into the wires and then the the energy goes into the wires and then the wire the wire energy into the light bulb and then the
myst_007096_2014-03-12_09-50-39_EE_2.1_024_comb i think the light bulb would like brighter electricity goes into all of them and goes out all of them because with two light bulbs the batteries on are basically dead but it can also be no never
myst_007096_2014-03-12_09-50-39_EE_2.1_025_comb i observed that the one would one d cell is not very bright but one more two d cells is very very bright what makes the bulb is turn off is that one d cell is turned right side up in the other d cell is upside down so that will not work may see that is all i have to
myst_007096_2014-03-12_09-50-39_EE_2.1_028_comb i am i observed that whenever you take a light bulb away from the it s not very bright electricity has to be flowing wellbeing through the d cell into the wires into the wires and out to the light bulb i don t know
myst_007096_2014-03-12_09-50-39_EE_2.1_011_comb electricity in a circuit is like the circuit is like holding the energy and then like the all by flipping it over i guess they could not to me about the electricity because the little blue dots reminded electricity more mobes means less light
myst_007096_2014-03-12_09-50-39_EE_2.1_012_comb the movement of electricity is like goes to everything and may be into everything i get what do you what else you want me to i like to and so then we would other people would get bigger ones it would take few fewer than ours ours would take more
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_058_comb take out a one hundred i knew it was a one hundred grams take out a one hundred grams and then it would go tonk but it is floating it is floating
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020_comb well i got well when we did it with a plastic chip i think we got a like somewhere around maybe five hundred and sixty-seven i do not remember or forty-four we got a four yeah four
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_012_comb well we we are using we got a plastic chip put it in we measured how much paper clips it would take to make it even it out get even more heavier i do not know it is something like that it is going like that because there is more there is there is like air in there so air is lighter than something solid so it would make the tip
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_072_comb cruise and go awesome paper clips okay and metal washers and we used grams to measure how much it was and that is we used paper clips and plastic chips and took away a little too
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_024_comb well we would have a measuring scale thing we would put it on this way and it would go like that and then we would u put more and more and more until it got evened out wha we were putting more paper clips in so the more weight on this one would make it go higher and then it would finally get evened out
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_022_comb wood pieces we did it a almost exactly the same and then we got not a five but i think we got a three because it was a lot lighter huh well since this one we u we we had a small one and so if we had a small one then we would measure it up
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_030_comb it there is more because it was there were less weight than the other one so they would that would be probably probably would not even use grams like a pound of something
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_048_comb that wor it is zero push then we are going to use some beans and since there is more weight here i bet you anything those are going to be light lighter beans are smaller than this and this is more solid than that so then maybe if this would not go in it probably will not make a difference
myst_996300_2008-11-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018_comb because if there is more if it was bigger it had more metal in it so it would be more heavier and then if if it was smaller then it it would have less metal and you can see how thick that one is and that one and that one has more metal than that one so that one would be lighter than that one i think there is a yeah there is mega grams but we have not studied about mega grams some people is mentioning like not kilograms but like like mebe mega grams and stuff like that
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_039_comb well i i know since i have been basically around the world i have been looking at the water and i have been having cups of water experienced stuff i had a cup and it would be really really heavy and i was only two to three so then that is how i know that just a little bit of water could be heavy it would just get really heavy put it on the scale and it weighs
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_109_comb it is saying that that is equal to the same so we take it out then we get it wet and is weighs three grams already so then we get it wet well it would look like this but sep with no water in it when you are basically when you are just a scientist you should measure like you would use kilograms and f there is probably no
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_137_comb yes if the airlock if all the airlock is going all the way to the top well a kilogram is heavier than a normal gram so a kilogram is probably going to be as heavy as you know what is cool is you do not always have to tap of that you can tap this part yep and then it gets heavier and heavier and heavier because the water is heavy
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_031_comb well there is air lockets that absorb water like what it shows right there and it spits out the air and it makes it bubble looking at the computer but the dry sponge didne did not even look like that at all no
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_103_comb we used grams and then we would put more more more until it would even out and then this would be three grams b because it is heavier than the ones we used we used at least two grams one gram yep you have a scale and then you weigh your fruits your vegetables and
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005_comb well we got a dry sponge and we weighed it seeing how much money er how much it weighed and it only weighed one ounce or two ounces and yep and then that that used to be full of air one thousand i already know that i did not have to look
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_119_comb it wa instead of always having to use just s small little pieces they can use bigger of one whole thing first we got the sponge w we measured we weighed the not the wet sponge but the dry sponge what happens if you actually wait what happens if you click on that one empty cups cups are like air light
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_063_comb the five hundred and ten it is it is like shrinking shrinking right here but right here it is getting smaller and smaller and smaller and then when we we put it in the kilogram one l of water liter
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_011_comb we put it in the water and and made it soak up all the waters it can and then we weighed it and then it weighed almost the whole back okay so you can go back up to here we got that put the water soaked it up put it there weighed it put anothe put the grams there and then
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_071_comb and that one would be ten grams because it is it still has a lotta that is a five and then that is a one then and then we put it in so what is going on here is there is a they are putting a sponge in a cup of water so they can weigh how much it is
myst_996300_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_019_comb then we got it wet soaked up all the waters it could then we weighed it again i see three apples like a little desk a candle two logs and gas it is heating up the wax and showing off the an apple and three apples and a solar pan
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_029_comb smells like gas because it is it is a smell energy and it smells really bad because it is dust i i think the girl is walking and she is walking really far and she is losing energy she is losing sleep energy and eating energy and but she is eating an apple which is getting her more energy so she can keep walk
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_027_comb well i do not think it is going to work because gas is not a source of energy it will not smell the earth well the tree it will not be good for the trees and everything she is getting the energy by her that apple she is eating
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_012_comb the wax is melting because the the flame is melting it and if you get too hot to the little flame you you could get really hot so it melts
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_030_comb i think the difference between the gas and the coal fuels is because the coal fuels do not it the coal fuels are burned and black because they have been used for heat energy which is a fire but gas is not a source that much it if you can count smell heat energy heat energy is another source of energy
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_036_comb i think they might they might contain heat heats because i know if you if you do that they will make fire and fire is a heat is a energy heat worth that much because it is nonrenewable you are giving our your energy because you are going you are getting it all focused on the sound and how you want it
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_007_comb have energy we would not be able to do much things and if we did not have energy and the light we would not it would be all dark and everything and when you go to school you are going to be all freaked out and you are going to run into people because the light is not on
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_009_comb the the heats in the fire because heat is a source of energy for example if you if the lights if we did not have lights we would not we would be freezing right now and heat is another source of energy that is why we need lights and we need heats
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_035_comb because the coal has been burned and the gas has not i guess
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_041_comb wood wool yarn wood stick sponge rubber band river rock plastic straw plastic chip cardboard and black rock those are it
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_019_comb see the girl is using energy because she is walking and she she is losing she is losing energy because she is walking but with the apple she is getting food energy which is giving her more energy to keep on walking can you repeat that
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_033_comb that the they both have a they both use a battery and they both need the sunlight or heat lights in order for them to work
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_016_comb see the flame it and then the was is like a person and it is running because the heat is too hot for example the sun if it is so sunny we get hot and we we because it is a source of light and energy it is heat energy it is important because they are a source of energy we have been building series of circuits
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_032_comb because they both need the sun and they both use they both are fuels and they both use d the battery
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_028_comb smells all foggy and stuff and it does not smell good and so and so that i do not think that is going to be good for trees environment or us even because the gas if you burn it to the coal it is not going to be good for the environment it it did not sound much it just went the wax melted and dropped i heard that but it does not make
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_010_comb warm because it is a it feels warm because it is a source of energy and we need energy to be warm and fire is a source
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_005_comb it is the wax is falling off because the fire is burning it and so the wax is falling off because the candle is getting heat and heat is part of energy so it is melting
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_003_comb i see the candle and the little black yarn is has a fire and the fire is melting the was and the was is going it is once dripped the apple and her feet
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_008_comb well i know that fools fuel fuels help us with energy because it has a source of it is a source of because the wax it it is melting
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_025_comb i see a solar panel three apples the little table three i mean two logs and a windshield and in the other side i see coal and and a gas
myst_007093_2014-03-07_11-24-36_EE_1.4_034_comb because they use the same amount of energy and use because the battery uses yeah because the i see that light bulb is not working because the switch is in on is like holding the electricity is going through light bulb a parallel circuit
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_055_comb the flow the electricity is going through all three wires it s not working anymore aa there were the light bulbs were lighting but there is the other one broke as they did a stuff light i get that they got it other one and it started lighting and that i do not know bulb starts working because like with the switch was out it was hold that energy from the light bulb
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_016_comb aa may be because it s getting too much light light bulb broke and it doesn t the ethylene work anymore because it s like already dried out and start we had seen a series circuit and a parallel circuit
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_013_comb the light the two light bulbs are lighting because the other one is broken and then what they do what they will was it doesn t work
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_006_comb i was aa the light bulb light because the energy was going that energy and electricity at was going but then the switch was going since the switch was going was not at all it is a work
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_054_comb i noticed that it doesn t work anymore because one of the light bulbs i think that the battery because you let me go what you were talking and i am
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_015_comb may be because the switch may be because the switch is like stuff and well that how was holded and electricity and stuff so yeah
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_041_comb think the light bulb at the middle doesn t work anymore because that s like old or it is getting too much electricity at they treat it and then if one light bulb goes out and it goes three it does it the two of the light bulbs don t work but when you change the light bulb they are bright again
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_027_comb they are all using one battery and like there are using a wire and they are all using the yeah like so wait that it another one is having out in through the widest side is out out through the widest side it is a plug
myst_007093_2014-04-10_12-10-23_EE_2.3_056_comb aa we really it doesn t work anymore because like well what are light bulbs does work but the other one these wires hold like energy and stuff because the switch is
myst_007093_2014-02-26_12-39-02_EE_1.3_007_comb i said that you need a battery which has stored energy inside it and then you need two wires a switch and a motor i hit the nail the nail is hm working because it s a stored metal so when i turned it to the switch its started to working very well and the little fly one more just tried in moving because i was getting energy
myst_007093_2014-02-26_12-39-02_EE_1.3_019_comb insulators are helpful its starts to move because it s like like happy its energy i mean that is not getting energy because the switch is at on and the wood stick is like isn t a type of metal so it won t work
myst_007093_2014-02-26_12-39-02_EE_1.3_014_comb it doesn t work because it s not like store of energy and because a battery works because that has stored energy inside it so all inside it and then it want the circuit will run because it is like its metal and in order for it towards that needs metal i see that the motor is moving because when i put the paper clip on top of the switch it started to move
myst_007093_2014-02-26_12-39-02_EE_1.3_003_comb the motor is moving its little flag because the switch is turned on we have been learning how to complete a circuit that there is a battery and the battery is giving energy to the wires and the wires are giving energy to the motor but the switch is on and because the nail is making it go on
myst_007093_2014-02-26_12-39-02_EE_1.3_017_comb conducting materials are helpful but the rest of that aren t where it s to other way over can you tell that marnie because it s not a source of electricity or a piece of energy that when you put the wood on the wood stick it is not working anymore because it s not type of metal or its type of source to make it
myst_007093_2014-02-26_12-39-02_EE_1.3_018_comb insulators or something that are metal and the more metal it is the better the motor is going to work because they needs metal and stored energy so get working and since you already have stored energy into the d cell or battery its helping the wires get energy and flow through the switch and in the metals help the switch go back and start the motor
myst_007093_2014-02-26_12-39-02_EE_1.3_008_comb to it when you put that paper clip there the switch is turned on so then i am it s the battery is giving all the energy to the wires and to the switch so that when the paper clip pushes it its starts the motor starts to work i noticed that when i pushed the d cell it turned around so that the minus sign is now giving energy to the light bulb and the plus sign is getting the energy from the other wire
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_020_comb the d cell the battery well light bulbs help you a lot because if it s raining or something you can like turn on the light bulb and it will be like dark or anything energy and how it works the light bulb wires and a battery they are stored energy
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_030_comb that s the wire on the right is giving the battery to the light bulb and then the the energy that the light bulb already used is going to be restored in the plus sign of the d cell
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_009_comb wires you can not like if there is a battery i mean if you had wires you could maybe put the wires next to the battery and it will give the light bulb some energy every time the energy is going to light bulb the light bulbs like waste the energy i notice that the wires are moving whenever i pushed
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_022_comb the wires are giving less energy to the d cell the plus sign it means that the that bulb gets energy and it light lights up the so we can see better electricity or energy
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_031_comb you do not connect the to the two wires to the battery the ba you won t be getting any energies for the light bulb to light up or anything because the d cell has stored up energy in there will not work anymore they have they help you see better like if it s really dark you can just turn the light bulb on and the light bulb on and it will give you
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_026_comb it goes back to its normal shape the i don t think it s supposed to be like that because the wires are supposed to be each ends
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_012_comb energy because batteries have stored energy and if you put the wires next to the batteries and you put the wires next to a light bulb it might light up because the wires are get the battery is giving the wires energy so it can give it s
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_029_comb that the battery the minus side is giving the energy to the right wire and the right wire is giving the energy to the light bulb and then the wire on the left is restoring the energy in the plus sign and the
myst_007093_2014-02-04_12-22-54_EE_1.1_018_comb the wires are giving electricity to the light bulbs and then the light bulbs that receive the energy er well it the wires are giving electricity to the light bulb the energy is getting the battery is not getting en enough energy anymore yeah battery giving energy to the wires and the wires giving energy to the light bulb
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_010_comb she like i told you the minus side is giving energy to the giving energy to the light bulb on this side on then like little bubbles of energy are coming and so it would be brighter and the energy that s already been used is going through the other one and doing the same thing and then when its all over it goes into the plus side of the d cell
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_020_comb its aa it was the light bulbs turn brighter because it s using two batteries and so that is two stored energies into light bulbs i think the light bulbs are going to be brighter because it s using to tube a d cells and like they have stored energy so it will work that the energy flowing
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_004_comb the d cell is giving is giving the wires energy from the minus side and its going and in the other wires like lighting up and just like really bright because the two wires are giving it i don t know
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_022_comb that when those one light bulb it just one focus and like when there is a one battery it doesn t light as much as the second one because there is two for each one
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_011_comb because that the minus side is giving energy to the wires and so like the evergreen into the evergreen though energy is going into the wire and its coming out through its going and into the light bulb so the light bulb can like shine very bright because its getting energy and everything and then the bulb that are already used its giving it s the other light bulb and is coming back to the d cell
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_007_comb it s just to be in a circle is very helpful because they has because the battery is giving in energy to the d cell that s how the light bulb is getting the energy improvement may be because if the wires are the battery is giving energy to the wire and that s why the light bulb is shining and its very very very very bright
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_024_comb because they needs another wire connecting to the plus of the wires and there are not supposed to be touching connecting the series circuit like it would not be the bright anymore well it will be bright because it s only used i think it won t work and i think really work light bulbs
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_015_comb well i think that the light the dots are the energy and like that s was just speaking the light bulb brighter
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_013_comb because they are coming through the d cell and the d cell has stored energy so if you like actually taken no not the stored energy from the battery is giving energy the stored energy to the wires and the wires are giving the stored energy to the light bulbs and then its passing it all over again into the d cell again
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_014_comb flow in like the battery and it has to has to go through the light bulb the wires the d cell as to go through uu light has to go through it has lot of things it s like the energy is giving the energy it s called to the light bulb and that s how its giving energy i guess
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_027_comb the energy stored in that because it s giving energy to the light bulbs i think that is the wire is getting energy and its going into the light bulbs so the little blue dots are like the energy coming he is a complete format for a light bulb to work
myst_007093_2014-03-18_11-07-43_EE_2.1_005_comb it s to be touching d cell and the wires because the wires are going to gain energy and by that one is going to be like a really fun and stuff like that so just get on the last part they make electricity go through the two wires are connected and the metal is touching its negative in positive side connected to light bulb battery light bulb and wire
myst_007100_2014-04-17_11-54-33_EE_1.1_007_comb two wires have to be connected to make a complete circuit now its going the opposite way but its going same way but if was turned around they would be go in the opposite way that they can conncet to each of them but if there if the two wires both at the base of the side of the light bulb it going to light up has it doesn t know
myst_007100_2014-04-17_11-54-33_EE_1.1_029_comb i noticed that the flip this that should i noticed that if you would put put it to the not the negative side they will go up that way but the people on the positive side then you know go the same way that it was in the begin its flowing throught the light bulb and to the positive side the really through the wires into the light bulb back into the one positive i do not know it has to take a path when you collect it
myst_007100_2014-04-17_11-54-33_EE_1.1_019_comb the two wires are connected to the and positvie side and then the negative goes to the side of the metal of light bulb and then positve side goes up in light bulbs are produces the electricity through the light bulb the ply is that it has to be touching metal with the two wires as we touching the light bulb then order of two
myst_007100_2014-04-17_11-54-33_EE_1.1_027_comb its going the different way its going like then positive side go in the negative side going these way so its going to the and negative side but even light bulb is must be one to the that s i but anyway its going the other it makes it work it is having the electricity going to the motor make a flag move that it s off the d cell it s off this the metal so it won t move the flag we ve been learning about circuits
myst_007100_2014-03-17_10-53-02_EE_1.2_028_comb that it runs when the flag moves because the cell is gain electricity from the sun that two wires are hitting the motor so was the two wires make electricity to the motor then the flag move the cell is hitting the motor and the motor set up the two wires all the way to the cell so while though that cell does hitting it it starts working let the switch has to be off the flag moves
myst_007100_2014-03-17_10-53-02_EE_1.2_030_comb it will stop working because it s not creating electricity it s creating a circuit that makes the motor run and makes the flag move the d cell is put does the electricity all away to the motor and making the flag move the cell has to be hitting it
myst_007100_2014-03-17_10-53-02_EE_1.2_014_comb when i click the switch and it goes on the metal it works and goes to the motor circuit it create electricity over that it is on it won t work because if it doesn t have if the sun has to hit that little contraction there then it will work it makes the flag move the flag moves
myst_007100_2014-03-12_12-27-59_EE_1.2_010_comb and electricity go through the two wires to make a flag move because the flag is metal on both sides so the metal touches that it turns on make through electricity it s not touching metal so where electricity won t go to the flag and it will make a circuit well if sun is sharing the cell then its working but when it goes off there is no work and the flag will
myst_007100_2014-03-12_12-27-59_EE_1.2_022_comb the cell has behind the sun and then the wires connect all the way to the contraction and then make reflective so electricity goes through the few thing over and over and over because the d cell has electricity in it so when then two connecters connect to the metal find on both sides as the switch touches metal then it will start working and create and put it would electricity to the flag
myst_007100_2014-03-12_12-27-59_EE_1.2_017_comb it s on the metal where the wire is so it doesn t count all the way but it goes on like so there just it is electricity pass there so they was on top what a pretty as much electricity the d cell has to be attracted two wires to go through the electricity to get to the move it has to be on the metal
myst_007100_2014-03-12_12-27-59_EE_1.2_028_comb the electricity goes through the wires and until it s cell and then it goes interact when will contraction and then it makes the flag move the electricity will go through the d cell and it will turn on the flag it s not going to till because the switches off and it s not creating a circuit to make the flag move the switch has to be on
myst_007100_2014-03-12_12-27-59_EE_1.2_016_comb that when i touch it it moves and then i touch it again it moves off the circuit so it will produce the electricity but won t does touch the metal and produces electricity
myst_007100_2014-03-12_12-27-59_EE_1.2_032_comb it s showing just circuit and just the d cell is going around at both of those according around so it can hit that with a motor and then the flag will move the flag stops moving because it does the sunlight and it is have electricity between the wires then it doesn t work
myst_007100_2014-03-12_12-27-59_EE_1.2_023_comb electricity is going through it to make it move one hm the metal is touching the switch so i already know that yeah i am good how are you i know you we met before but no i do not want to meet you because there not metal like all the other once because the switch is metal so that s metal so it is make in a work it works because it s a metal all the objects will not make electricity go
myst_007100_2014-04-17_12-10-03_EE_1.3_011_comb insulators are some stuff that is not metal but hum conductors are things are metal that makes just sitting i do not know can you repeat that please it is not going because if that is not metal then work metal is something if something is metal then and it sticks to something all sides metal then it would work and it would complete conductor we seen each other before electricity is going to through the nail
myst_007100_2014-04-17_12-07-26_EE_1.2_004_comb electricity is going through it okay we have been learning science you can talking to me about it i talk to you later bye i do not know because they are all a meter instead of like a s a kilometer same length so it would be easier
myst_996226_2008-17-11_00-00-00_MS_1.2_044_comb a meter tape i mean the meter stick would probably be easier to also really easy to use because all my dad is are the same length okay that it was ten s centimeters long use their straws and you might have used different straws
myst_996226_2008-17-11_00-00-00_MS_1.2_066_comb so you know how long it would be instead of just guessing and it would maybe some people got it right and people got it wrong and you would maybe you would get different lengths and be hard to make houses and buildings that would be pretty bad be about that big and group a would be su
myst_996226_2008-17-11_00-00-00_MS_1.2_052_comb you would know how long it wa would be yeah one would be smaller and one would be s huge to measure things a meter stick it is it is like a tape measurer but instead of using inches you would not use m me meters with a ruler or tape measure rul most rule most rulers are the same
myst_996226_2008-17-11_00-00-00_MS_1.2_002_comb we have been measuring we have been doing measurement and we have been measuring with straws my dad measured wi builds buildings so he uses a lot of this stuff
myst_996226_2008-17-11_00-00-00_MS_1.2_006_comb well we were trying to trying to decide if it was a good thing to measure with and we did not think it was that good to measure with because there is different lengths of straws that a ruler would be easier to use
myst_996226_2008-17-11_00-00-00_MS_1.2_008_comb no we all had the same but if you measured with straws maybe someone will would u maybe you would say i want m my backboard to my bed ten straws high and the other person might do it you you would put the zero on the edge and see how long it would go til you hit the other edge of the paper
myst_996226_2008-17-11_00-00-00_MS_1.2_030_comb i know it is a one hundred a one hundredth of a centimeter because the tape would have marked the spot m yeah metal washer a and the metal washer was the heaviest and the block i mean the wood square was the lightest
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_040_comb because you would not get the right amount of apples or you would get confused so it is not that so you should not measure with paper i mean weigh in with paper clips pounds and that stuff the one that went up went lower was the one that is heavier it was about
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010_comb plastic i mean no not the chip was second heaviest and the s square of wood was the lightest we just started it on the unit on friday
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_002_comb we weighed in three things and we found out that we weighed in a block zero a little square wood plastic chip and a nine paper clips
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_058_comb we were trying to find out what one was heaviest and finding out if it if it would be a good thing to use to f try to find what things e it would be harder to use paper clips because you would keep on getting mixed up
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_024_comb we we wen and w we went and got paper clips to see how much they would weigh so first we did the plastic chip i want i mean if you came up to someone who worked at a grocery store and said you wanted
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_030_comb because if you came up and said to a carpenter the metal washer with the plastic chip to see if they to see what one was heavier and the metal washer was n so it say one it w you wanted one of something it was about
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_012_comb we guessed first and then we and then miss wa miss wagner put it probably it would not it the number would not be lower or higher it would be just right so it would be easier
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_006_comb and our group said that it is we should not measure with the i mean weigh the it is not a good way to weigh since a po one weighs you can not there is no there is no bigger pounds and no smaller pounds so it would be easier
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008_comb stuff with the blo the wood because some might weigh different kind i mean different pounds different amounts
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_028_comb we did not get all the s we did not get the same answers because some of the paper clips were bigger and some of em were smaller and we found out that you should not weigh stuff with paper clips either
myst_996226_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_082_comb some paper clips are not the same size and something like pounds easily weigh the s are u weigh the same always and paper clips there could be big sizes and small sizes so
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_024_comb the one lightbulb was off it it was just one wire that was connecting from one battery so it was going through to that one lightbulb and not to the other there were three lights then the batteries would kind of be like one for two lights they would not work as well
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_016_comb that is basically what we did today we would have the wire in between the two well it the electricity is flowing through the wire so the there is one battery and then then there is a wire in between it and there is another battery that and it will go through but just like if the batteries touching each other and it will go around and light up each light bulb
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_027_comb yeah it think they are both on but the battery can not give as much power to both of them it can only give a little bit of power so they are duller they are not as bright as the one with two batteries where they get a lot brighter
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_006_comb the batteries had to be flipped around right because if it was a positive side going to another positive side it would not work out it would not let the electricity flow through but if it is a negative side to a positive side you can let it flow through everything stayed the same it did not like take a wire out or anything and i can not see a switch so i do not know
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_017_comb electricity flows through the wires and lights up the light bulb yeah it could there could be a wire in between the two things and it would act it would be there could be a wire in between the two batteries and it would act the same as if they were touching each other
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_012_comb the positive side is facing the negative side and they are touching each other then they are able to connect to each so it is kind of like another wire connecting to connecting them together but it is just they are touching each other and then on the other sides it is able to use and it probably gives more power can i see it when they are on again
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_010_comb the electricity is flowing through the wires and into the and the little wire the little bare part of the wire is connecting with the wire inside the lightbulb and it is going up and letting the elec the energy light it up when the we yeah we would need one more battery i think yeah they turn off
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_011_comb the batteries are acting as one with they are connected basically so and it is on one side of the battery on the negative side of the battery it is going up to into the light bulb and it is lighting the lightbulb up but on the other side it is just going through to get to the other side of the battery
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_025_comb when i clicked on it it was on but when i clicked on it and at the beginning when there was not a d cell then it was off one of them was off
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_003_comb we have in we have been doing well we are trying to light two lightbulbs in one circuit now so we are trying to light them with battery and use one battery and make and you just use one circuit
myst_997286_2008-18-12_00-00-00_ME_3.2_021_comb zero if the and the negative side are to are facing so the negative can not go through with another negative just like a positive can not go through with another positive so it can not let the electricity go through it has to be a and a minus
myst_997286_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_021_comb well we did not use magnets so they could not push each other away but it was kind of but we did not use another magnet not really because well we we used more iron to find the magnets more than other magnets cause we were not allowed to use another magnet cause it would make it a lot easier and we would not find out what in that bag that we had had iron in i
myst_997286_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009_comb that the metal that the iron was pulled by the magnetic force from the magnet it when so it became a temporary magnet that just pulled it and also s when if you use magnets on a pencil you cou if you put a negative side against a positive side it will bounce around so there is another magnetic force that you can use
myst_997286_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011_comb it use it it uses it to make the iron a temporary magnet against it and i thought what was important was thanks i had a great time the motor had the wire the i think so
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_013_comb on each side of the battery we had to put the bare pa the bare part of the wire where it is silver not on the other places because if it was on the other places then it would not work it had to be where the energy comes out the energy from the wires was electricity and it came through the wires and onto the motor and in and when it hit inside the motor it spun around the flag spun around really fast
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_021_comb it goes from the sides of the battery where it k where the electricity can go out of the battery and onto the wires and then it goes around and into the motor so it the electricity flows in a circuit and it flows through the wires and onto the motor which makes it run
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_015_comb there were t there was i am not sure cause the wires was connected it either went through cause there was tape on the sides so you could not really see or it either was two wires coming around or just one wire going all the way through around it is a circuit but it is a s it l it is a circuit but it looks kind of like a square right now
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_069_comb so the battery gets insi inside the two things and the electricity flows through into the light bulb that is the second thing we did in science where we used the battery to go around like that into the light bulb and light up the light bulb there is still a s
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_045_comb the switch will take the wires and it will turn them off because if when the electricity is flowing through it it will flow through the metal and if it does not touch the other connected thing then it will not be able to go through and ma and light up the and make the motor go round and round
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_019_comb the battery the battery carries electricity and it well what do you mean by that the electricity is coming from the battery to the motor and making and letting the motor run i see that
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_051_comb that is why it is kind of like an on and off switch because if you connect the switch to the other wire then the electricity is allowed to go through and it will turn on the motor but when it is not then it is not connected and it will not be able to go through to the other side of the wire where it gets connected to the motor you put the battery into the place right at the bottom left corner and then you would ha
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011_comb we had to have the wire on the battery the motor had a little flag on it and when when you had it connected upright it spun
myst_997286_2008-08-12_00-00-00_ME_2.2_043_comb that is the on and off switch the thing that is unconnected because the electricity if that motor is not if that switch is not connected to the thing the electricity cannot flow through it will not go through the wires and connect onto the motor because it it is it will go out and it will not hit the other wire so that is kind of like an on and off switch so it is pretty cool
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_018_comb not really cause we all had different bottles every group so not really well becau we had a one thousand and ten but we also had this cup that was a one hundred so we used that too so i sorta you know
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_020_comb well we could because we looked at the water level so when it was like by to the top like this would be the top of it and so we and this is the water point so we would s so if it is this high we would know like probably one thousand and ten mo ten more yeah not all the way not all the way
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_084_comb well because the if you use the same size everyone would have the same answer basically unless one is wider so so you are more the last one
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_090_comb so like if you are trying to measure how much there is in one bottle but you already but you do not know because there is because you al because you used a different bottle to do the to do the thing b so it is just better to use different sized yeah cause i do not really think you could put the top in there anyways
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_074_comb because if you want to fill it up to like the fifty you would look at the lines and and you would pull it up until it and until it matches up with the fifty the the this bottom part well this is one milliliter this is one hundred milliliters and this is like a one thousand so you can like see the huge difference between them
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_060_comb well if she is like what science what science people do use so because if we just use the cup those probably would just spill out and that would probably be spill out too so huh well then probably have the same thing twice i am not sure how many times but
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_094_comb no b the other people were saying like well their bottle was like one bottle bigger than ours and they were like saying like two thousand and stuff so theirs is one bottle bigger so i just picked a one thousand so
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_036_comb i do not think i would use like a syringe well i might use a syringe i might use a syringe but it i think it would take a while so to fill up that i would probably use like a cup a cup so just get the water dump it in get the water dump it in the lines well they they just tell you how much how full it would be it
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_082_comb no not really it was it was just like seven up bottles not cans but bottles like the bo the big bottles yeah yes no it does not look the same but it is the same because it is just that this is more taller and this is more wider but if you like if you like shrunk this into that it would be the same
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_038_comb yeah because you know it is a one hundred so you know it is going to be right there but you would have to do it ten times so yeah
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_058_comb well maybe you could pick both of em up at the same time and then that and then you could like weigh sorta or you could use a scale with the fulcrum and the balance and the base and you could just put those on one side but it would have to be it would have to be scientific like not with the cups or anything so i would put those on one side and then that on the other you would wait til it leveled out and it would probably be pretty by to the same
myst_996297_2009-14-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_062_comb well it is it is it is the same thing as the other one except they just flipped up it seems like this is a one thousand of those gram pieces and then this is probably if you stick em all together like really tight it would probably equal that
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_028_comb it is just like a little well we do not really use a real like gram thing we just use a paper clip so it is sort of hard to like explain how they like make em and stuff so yeah w f first i hold it in my hands and i weigh it and then i put it in it and then i guess
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_048_comb well we usually do estimates to like make our brains more used to it because most people do estimates and if you get used to estimates it will help you like by working on like co mass and measurement and that
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_038_comb well they they look the same except like the ten is bigger than the five and the five is smaller than the ten and the twenty is the biggest well just when we are working with science like that is like right before lunch yeah this is like exactly what we use we are working with that that and that and then i put in the bag and i waited until it got like level and it
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_014_comb a fulk the fulcrum is the tip that you that you are supposed to put the balance on it and it is like this and then this is like the other s sides and then it is like this what the fulcrum looks like and then the balance is on top like this
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_062_comb this well that is the fulcrum and it is the part where where you put the balance on like and it is where you get it like even zero yeah and it is just because if it is like way down here you would not guess like one gram because how could that be possible
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_016_comb well it just let us the balance s it makes it steady and not like wibble wobby
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_072_comb yeah we we talk about it a few a two ti a few times but we have only done science twice since we have finished african americans and those people like the up arapaho cheyenne jutes and so otherwise we have only done two lessons in it we do it every wednesday and we are learning about like the base the fulcrum and the balance
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020_comb well grams they use em in the metric system not the not our system s and we are just using the metric system because it is it is better to learn like all the systems around the world because i just learned that we are the only country that that does not have the metric system and i hope we switch to metric system somed yeah because the metric system is like so much easier
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_022_comb well because like a well like a foot like it is twelve it is not ten so that is prob that is like weird because it would be more easier if it was ten and like a yard it is three feet so
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_034_comb no well that is not one gram the well the little ones are five grams the littlest ones like that look like that are five grams and then the bigger ones are a little big bigger than that
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018_comb yeah well you have to like wait til it evens out and then you check really good and if it is even then you then it is good
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_064_comb well you could like you could take the orange out you could weigh a different thing then you could see how much that weighs and then you can put that thing in and put the back orange in and then you can and then you know how much that thing weighs so you know that is how that is how i would do it because i usually run out of them yeah huh
myst_996297_2008-17-12_00-00-00_MS_2.2_078_comb i probably use that instead of a whole bunch of those cause that is like way bigger than that so that one is probably a better like thing to put in the cups and you know i put the things in the buckets to see how heavy they were it will help you know the exact si the exact way about it and it is very important use a scale they all are made of different me materials so they make different so they weigh different things
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_030_comb to find out how heavy the metal disk is see there is eight grams in this cup so the cup is this metal disk is equal to eight grams that is how you can figure it out the weight is heavier and so it is just a lot easier to use the one on the right is heavier
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_014_comb to see how much they both weigh y we are trying to see how many paper clips will fit into each cup into the cups to make it equal to the plastic chip the things are being put inside the bask int the things are being put inside the scale
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_032_comb important to find out the mass of an object because you will not know how heavy it is and if you do not know how heavy it is you could not get it it is like say for instance if you are getting a bed it is supposed to be eight grams heavy you would not know how heavy it was supposed to be unless you weighed it and found out
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_015_comb to see what material they are made of and then we would be able to find out how heavy they would be paper clip is not equal to one gram one gram is a lot lighter than a large paper clip because a paper clip et weigh a large paper clip weighs more than one gram
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_016_comb it is important to get the accurate measurements unless y if you want to get if you want to know how e much something weighs n to get if you are going to buy something we have been practicing measurement
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_031_comb as long as it is heavy er so you can make it equal if it is equal that means how many of them are ther are in the cup that has the grams in em the more the eqe the weight you count the if you count them you can find them you can find out how heavy they are
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_026_comb grams are well grams are the equ are the weight agreed all all around the world and grams just are equal so everyone knows what they are i could use them to put the things on the scale and see how much they weigh
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_025_comb it is all about one gram one gram equals just about one t p tiny particle of each tw thing we have here
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_023_comb it is all about helping you get the equal answer if you have four paper clips on something that means it is four papel clips heavy but it can be he a bigger paper clip and the paper clip will be a lot heavier if it is bigger we measured them and find out how heavy they were and it was pretty cool
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_022_comb weighing the plastic disk was all about about seeing how many grams it was and wha and how mu how heavy it would equal is figuring out how heavy it is to make sure they are correct we could put it on a scale
myst_990630_2010-08-04_00-00-00_MS_2.1_027_comb the paper clip if it was lighter it would eve weigh less but if it was heavier it would weigh lea less it would weigh more so you would have less to use if you had it heavier but you would have more to use if it was lighter their mass is heavier so they weigh more metal is heavier than plastic and wood so that makes it heavier
myst_997472_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_011_comb the one on the top is attracted to the other one a but the one on the bottom is repealing the other rock has iron or steel in it that it will a that it will collect all the iron things or the ones that have steel in em learning about electricity and magnetism
myst_997472_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_014_comb north and s n and s are on one side they will attract but if like n and n or s and s are on one side they will repel steel nail has steel in it and the aluminum nail is alunimum alunimum does not attract to magnets the magnet is attracting iron and the stuff that sticks to magnets
myst_997472_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_008_comb the ones with iron and steel in them connect to the magnet it is a magnet the some of the things that do not have iron in them will not stick to the magnet like the brass ring or the crafter is stick maganets attract that means they stick together if they repel then they are apart from each other
myst_997472_2009-07-12_00-00-00_ME_1.1_004_comb that some sides stick and like if you put it on a certain side it does not stick it let us go apart if the pools are facing together they might stick but if they are facing apart they will separate
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_014_comb i see a light bulb and that one of the wires is connected to the side and the other one is connected to the bottom and that it lights up when that happens they mean that the wires on the motor stop there and are connected to new wires
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_011_comb there is a it is like a closed circuit and i do not see a switch there is no switch it is just the battery and the wires and the ba the light bulb receives the energy from the battery and then sends it some of it back
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_004_comb the motor i mean the d cell helps you helps it run because without it there is nothing like you could really do i mean it would not work the electricity is flowing through the wires and both wires are connected and the the energy flows out of the negative side and comes back at the positive side
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_017_comb a schematic shows you a simpler way to draw or tell someone how to sh do something or go somewhere instead of a light bulb there is a motor and it is connected to the d cell battery they tell you how to connect the battery and wires to the light bulb and show you in a simpler where way
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_005_comb you use the d cell to make the motor run or the light bulb light without it you could not do anything i forget its name but i think it starts with an s and it uses symbols to tell you instead of just drawing all the details
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_018_comb you have to make sure that both ends of the motor are connected to the batteries and that i mean the wires and then the wires are connected to the batteries properly for the motor to run
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_021_comb the names of a those little circles at the bottom are called terminal connectitions an and if you do not have it then you and if you do not connect anything to the motor the motor is not going to run you connect the wires to it and then it flows to the battery and that starts moving the motor on the top
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_003_comb the d cell is a source of el electricity to turn on something we have been learning about magnets and electricity the one that looks like sort of like a switch but is not it is for your circuit to be closed if you open it then you do not then your circuit will be open and the light bulb or motor will not work but if you by it it will work
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_008_comb it is a closed circuit and so the energy can not go out but if one of the wires were open then you could not do it they are wires that you use to connect the d cell to the the motor or light bulb
myst_997472_2010-11-01_00-00-00_ME_2.2_016_comb this shows you that this circuit is open and that the motor can not run because they have not closed the switch there are no wires connected to b under those brads there is a wire and when the two wires touch the brads s the wire immediately b makes the open circuit a closed circuit
myst_997472_2010-25-01_00-00-00_ME_2.4_002_comb today we did this fun mystery thing with wi finding wires we found out where the wires were by testing them with our boards to light up the light bulb if we touched two wires and the light bulb did not light up that means there is not wires connected to them
myst_997472_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_012_comb more washers you put in there like if you put twenty they will probably separate quicker you should have the right material and just set it up right if the distance between the magnets are a lot then the less washers it will need like if you have a lot of spaces in between them you are probably going to end up with one washer
myst_997472_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_014_comb the magnets repel themselves because of the space is taking away most of the force do not put any spaces in you get a higher number but if you put five spaces in you get like three or two or one or something spaces in between the two magnets make little force for the magnets so when you put one wash
myst_997472_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011_comb if you decrease the washers the force of the magnets will get less and less and then soon they will repel themselves you kind of see how many washers it took t for the magnet t tise the magnets to separate the magnets had to repel themselves because of the weight on the other side it was too heavy for the f magnet f force to stick together
myst_997472_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_007_comb the nineteen washers separated the two magnets if you put the mag if you put the washers inside and count up to nineteen it the two magnets will probably separate by then i do not know what the answer is the nineteen washers broke the force of the two magnets
myst_997472_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008_comb the washers are stacked up and if you put them gently on you can count out more but if you like slap em on you will get less and the magnets will break sooner follow the instructions and be creative learning about magnetism
myst_997472_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_016_comb if you have more spacers the magnets force will be less so therefore your washers that you put in will turn out less because you have the spaces in between the magnets the magnet will repel themselves because there is so much space between them that they can not attract anymore
myst_997472_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009_comb the cup on the right filled with washers is too heavy for the two magnets to stick together anymore group c just dumped the who whole j dumped five washers in to the cup instead of putting them neatly like the rest of the groups that is why the rest of the groups have more than five washers
myst_997472_2009-14-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_005_comb the cup on the right the nineteen washers inside of it is breaking the force of the cup on the left which are the two magnets connected we have been using magnets connecting on the things that we do not know that they would stick when i click the thing again it will turn the battery around and it will not the lights are get them
myst_007094_2014-04-02_12-48-47_EE_2.1_024_comb because it is not in the right pathway well but not the plus the plus signs you have to be facing up the plus sign have to be facing the other but one on the left touch be facing the other direction on the front of that it goes through the plus sign down to the minus it has to go through the circuit closer the little power sources that are in the that are in the wires and
myst_007094_2014-04-02_12-48-47_EE_2.1_022_comb on the right one when time passes the light bulb runs out so i have to replace it many many times because hm more energy is being taken from it it has to flow through through the wires completely and if you get stuck or when i click on the d cell it moves it it moves the direction and it actually flows in the circuit this time
myst_007094_2014-04-02_12-48-47_EE_2.1_020_comb the one with only one d cell the lights are dimmer along with two d cells the lights are bright when we use the wires the battery and the light bulb all make a pathway and this it goes through and it makes a complete
myst_007094_2014-04-02_12-48-47_EE_2.1_009_comb on the power when it moves through on it goes through the wires and into the little things that are in the wires and if they move around and that kind of vibrate yeah hope such huge energy so we do not have to do would not show turn the battery around to make light or to use like a

myst_007094_2014-03-20_11-45-28_EE_1.4_004_comb it is a candle that has a light it give out more air because of the the it has a big impact and that effects the air it will make a fire i do not know i do not know it burns and the wax it melts i do not know it gets polluted with smoke it is important cause it helps us light things and it helps us use things a lot better the wax is melting off of it
myst_007094_2014-04-10_12-55-44_EE_2.3_030_comb there is different wires connected to it one of them goes off one of them stage on on there is four wires once connecting in they are both connecting into different circuits so they both of the light bulbs to have to be connected for one to work the bulbs running now this time it is connected to the series and when the when one of the filament breaks it stop
myst_007094_2014-04-10_12-55-44_EE_2.3_019_comb and one of the one of the parts of the circuit break because it is just to in one circuit it is not multiple circuits working flow through different parts of it a series circuit because the magnet it is not a complete circuit there so many wires connecting to the battery and it is it is going in one circuit on different light bulb you have to replace it
myst_007094_2014-04-10_12-55-44_EE_2.3_006_comb when i click on it and it moves to the metal part and it watch the bulb but i think that happens because it is flowing through the circuit because runs at flowing from the battery into the wires and out of the one of the light bulbs into the other one the filmament breaks it it is not a complete circuit anyone one of the light bulb stops not both of them nothing happen because its not connected to a you have to replaced
myst_007094_2014-02-04_12-51-08_EE_1.1_031_comb because the to the ends of the wires they have the metal on the bottom and on the sides and when you put on together and the other metal metal makes electricity just like when lightening sharks metal it makes a light source i am not sure it does not do anything it means and there is a pathway inside it to help the power source keep going
myst_007094_2014-02-04_12-51-08_EE_1.1_003_comb battery a light bulb and a couple of wires when you turn it it goes the other way again bye and i can not see picture by the way going to the negative side no light came enough i just do not know why it is just i did not know the electricity well we have been learning how to light a light bulb with wires and battery
myst_007094_2014-02-04_12-51-08_EE_1.1_014_comb they help you see when it is dark instead of a flash light that you have to hold in your hand well the wires helps the power because they melt the metal on the ends and they help when you put them on the side of battery it help to rifht the light bulb because the wire has power resource
myst_007094_2014-02-04_12-51-08_EE_1.1_017_comb i see the power source going through the light in the inside of a light bulb it is going on the metal over the filament and back out down and it is keep going through it through the battery and around and around and it gives power from the battery to the light bulb to light the light bulb up
myst_007094_2014-02-04_12-51-08_EE_1.1_010_comb the metal makes it over when you put it on the side it give some power and it flows through to keep the battery the battery go through that eleven part is on the side on the light bulb one part on the bottom and it goes through the light bulb through the battery and into the wire i notice that the top of it when you have the top of it it goes down it always goes from top to bottom
myst_007094_2014-02-04_12-51-08_EE_1.1_019_comb it goes through the wire and it goes through the wire and normal it is going through it is going through the battery in the power source from the battery around go in goes into the light bulb comes out of the light bulb and goes around into the well they give power to whatever you are trying to use
myst_007094_2014-02-04_12-51-08_EE_1.1_008_comb it is important because to adjust the wires and the plain light bulb wouldn t work because you need a power source to help it is going faster and faster it is a power source of energy like electrical energy it receives power and from the wires and the battery the negative side
myst_007094_2014-02-04_12-51-08_EE_1.1_032_comb it wouldn t light up because you have to have it between in different parts and there is nothing really else to talk about because insulators just it is making it work now i m trying to make circuit in different achieving
myst_007094_2014-02-26_11-24-19_EE_1.3_018_comb and they have sort some sort of thing that they are made of that does not that does not help you work like the paper clip i clicked on yes it work it s either a part of metal or sliver something and metal only so were all make it work the insulators do not make it complete circuit

myst_007094_2014-02-11_13-08-18_EE_1.2_021_comb think whenever i click it it moves and it gives power and no no more we have been we been making a light bulb light up and making a motor run by wires and i think i mean the switches to be down for the well we did not actually learned about some year because the power that we got delayed by the snow
myst_007094_2014-02-11_13-08-18_EE_1.2_010_comb it is not connected right so it is not working i do not know gives power and an energy source good how are you it is moving and it is important because it is giving his power i mean some power has to go from the wires on to the thing to make it have power
myst_007094_2014-02-11_13-08-18_EE_1.2_003_comb the bad the d cell is connected to the wires and the wires are connected to the motor and that energy sources going through the wires into the motor the background changes and the sun makes it toward the cloudy day goes away when you when you click on it the sun rises and works it does not spend the switch has to be down it gives it gives some the source power
myst_007094_2014-02-11_13-08-18_EE_1.2_023_comb switch has to be down and everything has to be connected the right way well there is no power source stoper so i think the tem the template gets gets on put in and the wires is go out into the flag the sun light is helping that that little thing work for the motor the power and the wires it has to be connected to the thing
myst_007094_2014-02-11_13-08-18_EE_1.2_035_comb it is working and the flag is to it is send all electricity through the wires into the motor around in the motor round back to the wire and back into the d cell and it keeps flowing and flowing and flowing i do not know you tell me this questions are hard i observe where the electricity is flowing inside the bulbs
myst_997470_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_012_comb in my opinion i think a parallel circuit would be better in a long string of lights so that in case one goes out there is still plenty left that are on the electricity does not travel through that bulb that burns out and the other bulb can not get its power and then the circuit is not completed and both bulbs go out
myst_997470_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_014_comb what happens when one bulb burns out is that the other bulb will be able to keep going because it is on a completely different pathway meaning that there will not be any obstructions to the flow of electricity
myst_997470_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_010_comb if i click on a bulb it burns out but since its a parallel circuit me meaning that each bulb has its own pathway it can sti one bulb can still stay on turned on the electricity has to travel through the bulb and if the bulb is not working then it can not travel through and it can not the electricity cannot power the next bulb
myst_997470_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_016_comb i think that the first bulb will shine brightly but the rest of the bulbs will shine dimly and in the case of one bulb going out they will all go out i see the bulbs turning on and off everytime i click
myst_997470_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_001_comb n not a whole lot all that we have really been doing recently is the last thing we did in science was making electromagnet then before that we made a parallel circuit it does not complete the circuit and the other bulb does not light
myst_997470_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_002_comb we have been working mainly with series and parallel circuits course just today we worked with electromagnets if one bulb burns out the power does not flow to the next bulb in line and it cannot complete the circuit
myst_997470_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_009_comb there is electricity flowing in two different pathways one for each bulb therefore if one burns out both one will still stay on as opposed to in series circuit where they both go out if one goes out
myst_997470_2010-01-02_00-00-00_ME_3.3_008_comb what is going on is that in the bulb the electricity has to go all the way through and when it burns out that means that one of the wires breaks inside the bulb so it does not go all the way through to the other bulb the lights turn off and yeah that is about it no we have not yet
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-29-14_MX_2.2_010_comb i think that the one on the right will weigh more than the one on the left number one is the most contrasted and then number two is the is the most diluted the grape thing the one to the left is more concentrated and the salt water water ones are
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-29-14_MX_2.2_012_comb because the one on the right is more contrasted than the one on the left you can tell if it is more concentrated if it is darker the the farther you go to the right the more contrasted you and the farther you go to the left the more diluted they
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-29-14_MX_2.2_018_comb number one is the most concentrated number two is the least concentrated my prediction was right the one on the right weighed more than the one on the left they both have seventy-five milliliters of water in it and the first one has ten grams of solute in it and the second one has grams of solute in it
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-29-14_MX_2.2_007_comb the feather weighs two grams the rock weighs ninety grams so the rock weighs eighty-eight more grams than the feather we been learning about saturation it makes the things more contrasted
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-29-14_MX_2.2_016_comb so number one is more concentrated than number two number three is more concentrated to number two and number one is more concentrated than number three so overall number three is the most contrasted than no number one is the most contrasted than number three and then number two is the most dilute
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-29-14_MX_2.2_006_comb no yes i am familiar with a balance can you even hear me zero my god it is still on the first one has ten the mixture on the right has has has more solute than the one on the left
myst_014017_2014-02-06_12-42-36_MX_3.2_005_comb they are reaching their limits of how much they can hold in the water the water can hold four scoops of citric acid but only three scoops of epsom salt it is about the limits about how much you can hold stuff solution a is a is is is is is is salt you can figure that out by draining it and seeing what it is
myst_014017_2014-02-06_12-42-36_MX_3.2_009_comb the saturation of the water because they have different density stuff i think that they are adding enough salt to make the water reach the limit about how much salt it can hold well i think the one the higher concentrated ones will have a taste that has more flavor
myst_014017_2014-01-09_12-29-37_MX_2.1_018_comb i think the one with less grape powder will taste more like water the taste is not as thick i guess
myst_014017_2014-01-09_12-29-37_MX_2.1_021_comb well like well an the first one it has more water so it is less concentrated than the one on the left which has less water which is more concentrated
myst_014017_2014-01-09_12-29-37_MX_2.1_008_comb i noticed that the one on the right has more so the the it is darker and the left is has less so it is lighter they go they the one the farther to the right the more concentrated it gets
myst_014017_2014-01-09_12-29-37_MX_2.1_007_comb the difference is the one on the right has less purple stuff the one on the left has less purple stuff how dense they are by their color we been studying solutions you can add more or less water
myst_014017_2014-01-09_12-29-37_MX_2.1_011_comb the the lighter one is has is less concentrated and the one on the right is more concentrated you can add more or less water that the more the more solute you add to the solvent the more concentrated it is
myst_014017_2014-01-09_12-29-37_MX_2.1_015_comb because you did not add as much solute that you did to the solvent so they are less they are more diluted they are diluted i think the one with the more grape powder will taste more like grape and the other one will taste more like water than grape you add more or less water martie two solutions are being made
myst_014017_2013-12-19_12-30-02_MX_1.3_015_comb think we used a different thing because there are paper clips which have magnetite in them so they would go with the magnet instead of just staying with others i am good
myst_014017_2013-12-19_12-30-02_MX_1.3_020_comb i noticed that the other stuff when it went through the sieve and i and i think we used the seam because the the things the materials with the big particle size will stay on the top instead of going through with the rest of the stuff
myst_014017_2013-12-19_12-30-02_MX_1.3_026_comb we have talked about evaporating using a filter and a seam and using magnetism to get magnetite things with magnetite out of the mix the rocks are staying on top because because their particle size is bigger than the hole
myst_014017_2013-12-19_12-30-02_MX_1.3_022_comb i did not notice anything else but i but i think we use the filter because the stuff stayed on top i noticed that the paper clips went with the magnet because they have magnetite in them different we use different tools for different mixtures because each mixture has different things that have different properties do not go marni bye
myst_014017_2013-12-19_12-30-02_MX_1.3_014_comb because the stones are bigger than their particle size is bigger than the holes in the seam thing whatever you said the important property is magnetism i saw that the sand i think went stayed on the top of the filter when the water and salt went through
myst_014017_2013-12-19_12-30-02_MX_1.3_008_comb property that is being shown is particle size we been talking about mixtures and solutions i noticed that the sieve stayed on top of the the filter when the others things went down that means well making the water not go well it is just making the water disappear to make the salt come
myst_014017_2013-12-19_12-30-02_MX_1.3_023_comb the one i picked was the salt because it is best for evaporating to make salt crystals it is a solution particle size and magnetism i noticed that none of the other things would go with the magnet the the paper clips are going to the magnet because they have magnetism
myst_014017_2014-02-03_14-02-06_MX_3.1_011_comb the amount of water has reached the limit of how much salt it can hold in i do not know can you help me they are tools to make a solution reached the limit of how much salt it can hold we used little gram grams to help us weigh how much how much it weighs
myst_014017_2014-02-03_14-02-06_MX_3.1_008_comb each time you add more salt the water gets a little bit higher and it it has left over salt from the bottom i do not know i do not know please help me i do not know you are going to make a solution they both have to weigh sixty-seven grams
myst_014017_2014-02-03_14-02-06_MX_3.1_015_comb the salt solution with fifty milliliters of water weighs more than the water with fifty milliliters because the salt added some weight you added three scoops and it can not it can not hold that much salt so some of it sinks to the bottom in a solid form
myst_014017_2014-02-03_14-02-06_MX_3.1_016_comb the solute the solute salt had weighed seventeen which made the solution weigh more seventeen grams
myst_014017_2014-02-03_14-02-06_MX_3.1_013_comb it is being the solute is being added into the solvent until the solvent can not hold anymore solute it is foggy and there is it is all blended into
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_034_comb well there are no bubbles and there was no chemical reaction but when they added together they the solution was purple the glow stick is being glowed when he when you fold it a chemical reaction is not taking place because there are not more than one reactants to be added together
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_044_comb a chemical reaction is being made as the glow stick is folded in half yes a chemical reaction is being formed cause add the water as the water and snow are being added to the bike a it is causing rust which is a chemical react
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_024_comb the citric hydrox and hydrox acid are added to fifteen milliliters water which forms a solution so the baking soda calcium chloride and water are being mixed together which forms a chemical reaction and after a long time precipitation is left at the bottom of the cup
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_010_comb in in cup one calcium chloride and baking soda were mixed cup two calcium and citric acid were mixed and in cup three baking soda and citric acid were mixed and nothing
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_025_comb all of the molecules in the different things are different the the no because to have a chemical reaction you have to have water i am doing awesome well the one to the left is acid the one in the middle is baking soda and the one on the right is calcium
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_036_comb the two things were added together which made a chemical reaction and then the they it went back to regular clear it can because everything on the earth will always be on the earth and nothing can disappear or be made learned about how to tell how if chemical reactions are being formed or not
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_040_comb it is not a reaction because there was not more than one reactant to be added the ice cubes floated to the top because they were less dense and the their was stuff on the sides of vinegar and baking soda were added together and when they were added together they created a chemical reaction which bubbled
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_037_comb a chemical reaction is taking place because when the two things are added it bubbles the ice cubes are floating to the top because they are less dense and then the water is getting foggy the carbon carbonated water was added to the cup and as it was being poured it was fizzing and then after a while it stopped fizzing
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_030_comb i do not think there was a chemical reaction because nothing did anything only the ice cubes were more dense than the water so they floated so what happened was when the baking soda or solute was added to the vinegar which is the solvent made a chemical reaction which created gas yeah
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_041_comb as the months passed different things are being put on the bike first there was rain which and then there was snow which made the bus bike a chemical reaction is not been happened here because nothing is happening when the grape taste is added to the water a lot of them keep their same product
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_019_comb yes the solution has blue molecules from the vinegar and white molecules from the baking soda and green molecules which represent gas
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_015_comb i noticed that the vinegar has blue and yellow molecules and the baking soda has white molecules and the the products has blue white and gray molecules i do not know help me they all look different water baking soda and calcium chloride
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_021_comb one cup has nothing in it and the other has water in it and then there is a spoonful of baking soda and a spoonful of calcium chloride nothing is mixed together so there is no mixture or solution yes a chemical reaction has been taking place because when you fold it in half it lights up which indicates a chemical reaction i do not know please help me we call these reactants
myst_014017_2014-02-11_12-29-45_MX_4.1_043_comb water and snow are being added to the bike which makes a chemical reaction which adds rust to the bike the two things are being added together to make them the two solutions make a chemical reaction because the the solution bubbled no i do not think a chemical reaction is being formed i think a solvent is missing
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-46-43_MX_2.4_006_comb so solution a is more dense than solution b because the gram went to the bottom and then the b went to the top well when you mix two solution salt solutions together one that the one that is more dense will sink to the bottom and the one that is less dense will go to the top float
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-46-43_MX_2.4_007_comb in solution they would sink and in solution b they would float it says that the blue is twelve grams when the green is two grams so it has ten more grams than it see you thursday it just stays at the top
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-46-43_MX_2.4_017_comb because the less dense one was at the bottom and then the more dense one sunk into the less dense one to make the thing that is in the picture
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-46-43_MX_2.4_004_comb if if if the thing that you dropped in the water floats to the top then it is less than it is less dense than the thing that float sinks they have more of the solute in them so they are more contrasted or more dense
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-46-43_MX_2.4_013_comb the one that is more dense will stay at the bottom and the one that is less dense will go to the you can tell because the blue has two thousand and twelve grams the green has two grams and the red has six grams and the blue is at the bottom which has the most and green is at the top because it has the least grams the cork is less dense than the penny and the penny is more dense than the cork
myst_014017_2014-01-28_12-46-43_MX_2.4_008_comb you can say that it is more contrasted because the the heavier one sunk to the bottom and mixed in with the lighter one they are being separated cause of their density we learned about saturation i think this means that solution a is more dense than solution b
myst_014017_2013-12-12_12-32-44_MX_1.1_011_comb they were taking raisins and m ms out of the nuts the salt dissolves into the water and to so the water stays the same this is a mixture where everything keeps their properties they all keep their own properties the sand stayed on top screen is separating the water from the sand
myst_014017_2013-12-12_12-32-44_MX_1.1_012_comb they are taking back their own property the water gets strained out of the mixture it is called a mixture and it is where two or more objects are together the salt dissolves in the water while the other two keep their own properties i see a salad nuts and water
myst_014017_2013-12-12_12-32-44_MX_1.1_022_comb that is called a solution we have been learning about mixture they are getting separated from each other the salt will dissolve into the water to make a solution eleven part needs to dissolve into the other the marbles are staying on top while the water goes through
myst_014017_2013-12-12_12-32-44_MX_1.1_029_comb solutions can not be separated because one of them has dissolved and the other and it can not be taken out the salt and water is a solution and the other two are mixtures we call that a solute i do not know because the gray stuff dissolved into the water they are straining the marbles out of the water call that a crystal
myst_014017_2013-12-12_12-32-44_MX_1.1_007_comb the pile to the left is a mixture the salad is green the mix the everything mixes together to make a mixture
myst_014017_2013-12-12_12-32-44_MX_1.1_030_comb the difference between a mixture and a solution is that a solution one dissolves and in a mixture both of them keep their same properties it is a good way to separate them they keep they are same mass they are mixing one ingredient into the water to make a mixture or a solution it tells you that things do not lose how much they weigh this is a mixture the mass is growing
myst_014017_2013-12-17_12-32-01_MX_1.2_019_comb i do not know i see that the water weighs fifty grams the salt weighs fifteen grams and then when you put them together it weighs sixty-five grams that the solute dissolved into the solvent to make a solute solution it is being evaporated i do not know the salt will dissolve into the water
myst_014017_2013-12-17_12-32-01_MX_1.2_006_comb the salt dissolved into the water and that is important because that makes the i notice that the salt in the the salt does not get filtered out it just runs through with the water
myst_014017_2013-12-17_12-32-01_MX_1.2_015_comb the candy is ten grams the raisins are twenty the nuts are twenty and all together the mixture is fifty grams and it has all the ingredients that we added into it we have found that a way to separate a solute is to evaporate the solvent the salt and water mixture is a solution and the sand and water mixture is a mixture
myst_014017_2013-12-17_12-32-01_MX_1.2_003_comb the top one is a mixture and the bottom one is a solution i notice that the solute does not get filtered out of the solvent we call it a solvent we call the thing that is dissolves is a solute i do not know
myst_014017_2013-12-17_12-32-01_MX_1.2_045_comb i notice that the salt dissolves into the water and then when the water evaporates the salt turns into salt crystals the salt is dissolving into the water solute is where one ingredient the solvent dissolves another ingredient solute into the solvent the solvent out of the solution that means that this is a mixture the water is being evaporated
myst_014017_2013-12-17_12-32-01_MX_1.2_034_comb filter out the solute in a mixture but not in a solution we have been talking about separating mixtures and solutions it is it is considered a solution i see that the solute in the mixture stays in the coffee filter when the solvent the water runs through back into the cup
myst_014017_2013-12-17_12-32-01_MX_1.2_027_comb this is a mixture and the stays on top because of it is particle that is a solvent the water weighs fifty before the salt the salt weighs fifteen and the solutions weighs sixty-five grams after the two things are mixed it is considered a solution
myst_014017_2013-12-17_12-32-01_MX_1.2_023_comb i notice that neither the water or the salt loses any mass the solvent is the is the water and it will dissolve the salt in this you can evaporate the water to make salt crystals biosphere is all living things

myst_004030_2013-11-19_09-57-04_EE_1.2_003_comb we have learning about circuits and other energy sources the switch is closed the flag is moving because the switch lets the energy flow through the switch is off it could be the wires so that the energy can go through
myst_004030_2013-11-19_09-57-04_EE_1.2_007_comb when the motor is running i think that the energy is being transferred from stored energy to kinetic energy the what is important is that the when the sun is out the motor runs but if it is cloudy or there is no sun the motor will not run
myst_004030_2013-11-19_09-57-04_EE_1.2_004_comb the battery is is transferring the energy to the motor by using the wires and the and then the since the if the flag is turning then the then the solar cell is they collect energy so motors and other things can run the motor will not run this is a circuit board
myst_004030_2013-11-19_09-57-04_EE_1.2_024_comb the motor does not run when it is when it is cloudy the solar cell is collecting energy from the sun and transferring that energy to kinetic energy to power the motor the battery provides the energy
myst_004030_2013-11-19_09-57-04_EE_1.2_019_comb the motor the solar cell has to be facing the sunlight in order for the motor to when the switch is open the the electricity is not flowing through the solar cell is not getting enough energy

myst_004030_2014-01-24_09-54-49_EE_3.2_002_comb i have been learning about how magnets do stuff the magnets are rappelling each other they when they repel each other the poles are south and south
myst_004030_2014-01-24_09-54-49_EE_3.2_010_comb there re are magnets and they re like doughnuts and one of the pair sticks together and the rest are floating they will repel each other
myst_004030_2014-01-24_09-54-49_EE_3.2_013_comb because because the compass use the earth s magnetic field the similarity of magnets are to attract each other are that they and magnets due to the magnetic fields so if the object is not a steel or iron objects can stick to the magnets

myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_054_comb well you just sorta look at something and you decide and you try to think you look at something that you might want to measure and then you try to think and then try to estimate it and then once you do like six you go back measure it and tell the difference so well the first one i was right on and then it got worse and then it got better and then it got worse and then it got better
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_004_comb well today we guessed we estimated how big the length of something and then we wrote it down and then we made these meter tapes yet yesterday and we used those to see how by we were and then we and then we showed the difference in between and our measuring tapes we made our meter tapes
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_050_comb you go back and what yeah cause sometimes you just want to make sure it is right well when you estimate sorta like when you are doing a math problem sometimes you estimate it before like rounding it and estimating it before you actually do it so you have an idea of what it will equal
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_008_comb and we knew it was over a meter cause the doorknob is about a meter so that is how we figured out if it is more than a meter or less than a meter and then we just sorta guessed yeah or he was thinking of the table what is a lengthwise it could not get through yeah it taught us about how big a decimeter is how big a centimeter is and a meter is
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_048_comb like maybe when you are making a house in in square feet and y you guess it is supposed to be fifty-six square feet but you fifty-six square feet but then they had to cut out a part so you have to take away let us say sixteen feet then you might estimate that to see what idea of how many square feet there will be and see if you are correct
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_024_comb well in my brain i was just sorta thinking of how long ten centimeters were and just sorta guessing and adding more on to figure out how big they were i am not really sure except sometimes when i think about it i do not get it i am not really sure well centimeters and meters both belong to the group of the metric system
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_070_comb well like sometimes you guess but sometimes it is like way off and sometimes you just guess and do not really think about it that much and it is like right well because i do not really know but they i think they just want us to be good estimators twenty each each row had twenty what was up with what
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_036_comb well they just wanted us to make them i think it was because we are going to measure with them and cause there is not enough meter sticks in the class or meter tapes in the class for everybody we would have to share so i guess we just made those to measure
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_056_comb like from like our white board our width of our white board yeah and like k two desk two desk widths two lengths of desk and then you just sorta go around and find stuff that you want to measure
myst_995057_2008-22-04_00-00-00_MS_1.2_006_comb well we looked at it and by centimeters and meters and we just sorta guessed i think they are the same size except maybe something is blocking the way a little and it is cutting a little off it the picture is telling how far the cork is flying with the flipper stick so it is it flew forty centimeters
myst_996437_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_002_comb yesterday we made this graph to finish the the how far the cork flew it is counting by 10s and it is moving up by centimeters you could change a lot of things with the experiment it matters
myst_996437_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_005_comb it shows how many centimeters so i and it goes up to five centimeters the flipper stick has the yellow line shows large foil ball that it might go slower because it is larger and it is bigger and heavier
myst_996437_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_020_comb s right it makes two graphs so it is two graphs so you do not know which one is right in one graph you need two separate graphs do eleventh then another twelfth because if you change a lot of thing it will the experiment might be wrong and you are not sure if it is right or not
myst_996437_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_006_comb the catapult and the flipper stick one picture shows it is one centimeter the other one shows it is five centimeters the variable you could test was the angle so it is going backwards forty centimeters
myst_996437_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_003_comb molly is my partner so she she did all the work because i was sick on monday and tuesday so i did not test them so i just copied down on her paper but she told me it it worked and it was good
myst_996437_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_007_comb i think the i think the longer one because it is farther and and the short one goes shorter so it is not that much space but the longer one has much space in them it is getting higher and higher
myst_996437_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_016_comb we kept the penny and the paperclip the same and the loop the same that you only change one thing at a time to the same thing so you know what changed it we taped a pencil to either a desk or a shelf and then we put the loop zero on the string on to it held the penny to the length of the shelf or the desk and then let go and counted how many swings it made
myst_996437_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_007_comb they changed when you change the length of the string and they also changed when you changed how high you hold the string we found out that the longer the string is the slower it goes the shorter it is the the faster it goes so shorter more swings longer more swings i mean less swings i do not understand that we made different sized pendulums and then yesterday we let them go at the same height and counted all the swings
myst_996437_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_010_comb so you can tell how it changed as you changed one thing at a time we found out or a ruler
myst_996437_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_006_comb i think the so basically the different lengths of the string changes what the how fast or how slow it goes i do not think the weight changes it i think that is what you asked zero on measuring tape
myst_996437_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_009_comb we held them to the exact length of the top of the desk and then just let go of em and counted how many times they went back and forth we sometimes added more string i think so then you i think that is all we did and we try zero yeah and we tried different heights to let it go and tried how hard we pushed it so you know what changed it and how it changed
myst_996437_2009-04-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_002_comb we have been learning about how you add things to change what happens to other things we taped them to our desk and then held them up and we all did the same thing and then we just dropped them i do not know what pendulums are that way we can see how things changed and what changes that we saw how fast they could go and it is easier to tell what is happening we built them out of paper cut cups
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_013_comb what is important about the calmness of the water is that it and it should not have any well the waves should not tip the waves over too much so then you would not cause then you would not know how much then it could tip the boat over and then you would not know how much pennies was supposed to be in it if it is calm it is a lot easier to tell it can effect it by the size or
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_016_comb it makes me think about how you can not just drop it straight down even if they are placed in different places so it will not fall it will still just sink cause of how much you push it down push it down and for how straight it is even though you may set it down perfectly it is not spread out so it may just need to go straight down if it is so then you know what changed and how it change thank you very much
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_020_comb well as you can tell for the one that has fifteen in it on the right side all of the pennies are to the side sta on to the right side stacked up that means the that the cup will tip and if you put too much on it will just flip over and that is not good on the left side there are twenty in it and just stacked up perfectly it is staying better up but it will stay up for longer but not too long
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_029_comb it i think what you are asking is that you can just change one thing at a time so everything has to be controlled by you it can affect it by the different size the placement or the way the water moves first we measured it then we s drew a cross
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_014_comb it makes me think about how on the right side it is they are spread out so it does not sink as fast and on the left side they are all just straight down and you probably just and it is sunk it is down more into the water on the left side and it is higher up on the right but it is probably because there are more on the left and less on the right
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_011_comb we gently set them into the boat and we tried to make them as even as possible so we could tell so they would not be just straight down so it would not tilt to the side and just sink much easier well i think there are different numbers of pennies in them cause they are probably different placements we have been building boats and seeing how much pennies can fit in the boat depending on the size or the the size
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_030_comb thank you very much marnie we figured out that different sizes can well bigger sizes can hold more pennies smaller sizes can hold less if you put em in too hard or you could push some water in it then it would change how much it could hold or you and if you put it t too much to the side then it could just flip over
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_003_comb we measured the boats and make them different sizes and then we put water in them and see how much water it can hold then we see then we let it float in water and see how many pennies we can put in til it sinks they float in the ocean and they carry people passengers and sometimes emergency luggage
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_004_comb they are designed to save people is lifes in in case a boat starts to sink or gets or something bad happens to it it can hold people and they can sail and they can take it back and they can sail back to a safe place or a different it was important so we could tell the difference of how many pennies it could hold
myst_996437_2009-16-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_021_comb we have to think about how you have to only change one thing at a time so you could make different things like we made different cups we did not just keep start with a big size and keep cutting it lower and lower we made different ones to check the size and put and then we just took em over checked how much water could fit in it and how much pennies til it sunk i figured i do not know vari variables are see you later on
myst_996437_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_013_comb i discovered that every time you change the capacity of the boat the number of passengers either goes down or up just like the capacity of the boat we changed the planes to how we changed no we did not really change anything i do not understand that
myst_996437_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_025_comb so the x axis the y axis and the and the y axis is how many passengers it can hold and the x axis is the capa the amount of capacity the boat is to see how much something is or how much it is about how
myst_996437_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_017_comb if there are any waves or how much or how you stacked the penny the passenger which is the penny or yeah that is pretty much it we did not we did not change anything how much water well how much wait i found out that you can
myst_996437_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_032_comb when you make waves the boat tips over i think that is what you are asking and when you stack the pennies wrong they flip over you have to stack them evenly
myst_996437_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_019_comb zero well if there are no waves it is fine it is much easier if there are any waves it could shake the boat and it could flip over also if you stack all the pennies on one side it will flip over but if you stack them evenly then it will just stay perfectly straight you can see how much things weigh how tall they are or things from biggest to smallest
myst_996437_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_022_comb it can also tell how big something gets and for example like how things go from smallest to biggest or how much things weigh or things like that the y axis is the the number of passengers the boat can hold that it depends on the capacity of the boat as the capacity of the boat gets bigger the number of passengers gets bigger
myst_996437_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_030_comb how many what vertical line as the capacity of the boat gets smaller the number of passengers gets smaller too so pretty much it is all about the capacity we did by us doing everything and everybody making their boats pretty much all exactly the same we changed how big the boats were
myst_996437_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_016_comb probably one hundred and fifty or around that i am pretty good
myst_996437_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_024_comb i notice once again that well i notice that with the same numbers of winds which is thirty-five and changing the number of passengers the distance will most likely change even though you are winding at the same amount of time
myst_996437_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_026_comb you keep adding one more passenger as you go more with more pas as you add more passengers the l line gets lower lower and lower
myst_996437_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_018_comb you think about how how much the distance changes when you add more passengers and how it kind of makes the line and kind of connects when you put it on a data chart
myst_996437_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_013_comb you can see is you add more passengers the the distance in centimeters gets that the plane flies gets lower lower and lower much much a lot lower we have been making planes and testing how far they can go with paper clips on them that is what i did in my test
myst_996437_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_019_comb the n number of motors that are the rubber bands well on the y axis is how far the plane went so the distance of the plane and the x axis is how many passengers were on the plane well that is how i graphed it at least the distance goes higher
myst_996437_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_014_comb i noticed that with once again with the line starts at six hu pretty much around six hundred and then just goes lower and lower and lower so pretty much diagnol we discovered that every time you add two more paper clips to the plane it goes a shorter distance
myst_996437_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_011_comb i learned that every time you add more passenger as the number of passengers gets higher the distance of the plane gets lower well gets shorter there is only ten wraps around instead ten wrapped around instead of more and it is basically the same thing but it is only picking up three instead of a lot more
myst_997276_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_018_comb it is the elec tricity is the thing that could the stuff that goes through the whole thing to make it work more washers are coming up to it coming up because it is getting stonger more washers would come up with it
myst_997276_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_010_comb we had had to wrap it around we wrapped it around more times as we went up because we were charting it down and we wrapped it up more and more we started at ten went to twenty then to thirty then we went to forty because we did not have enough wire for fifty if the magnet would not pick up any they would not pick up any you would know that it would not be working
myst_997276_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007_comb yes well it would not pick up anything if it was not working so i think it is great
myst_997276_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_016_comb because of more of the it is flowing more of it is flowing through and it is building making it a stronger magnet to go back into the into the bat battery and go around again but it has more to pick up more
myst_997276_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_013_comb if you wrap it around less it will pick up the more you wrap it around the more washers it will pick up if you wrap it around less then the littler it will pick up it would not act as a magnet it would act like a normal piece of metal instead of a magnet we made an electromagnet
myst_997276_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_011_comb well we wrapped the wire around and the more times that we wrapped it around the stronger the mag it turned into as a magnet so we the more times we wrapped it around the more magnets we could pick up the irons
myst_997276_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_021_comb if we did that the wire would not even know that the magnet was there so it would not pick up any
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_048_comb they will stick because since the magnets rubbed on th the steel the nail then that makes it so that since they rubbed together that makes it so some of the magne it makes it m a bit magnetized so we can pick up the paper clip
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_076_comb they attract each other even though it is through the thin cardboard it would not do it if it was thick the other magnet because you are on top of the first magnet zero that the nail just kinda does what the magnet can do it does that because it is only for a little while because it can not stay like that unless you maybe do it again
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_008_comb we found out the paper clip and the n net the nail did they came together because the what they are made out of f would c would make them come together so that they could sometimes go through stuff
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_074_comb they are attracting each other so they can come together not as long as like something you can not stay like that as long as a magnet it did not always stick all the time but sometimes it did yeah some of them sticked with some some of the iron filings sticked but some did not
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_020_comb we took some steel nails and a lot of other stuff to see what would come together with it attract and what would not the nails and the paper clip and the rock the s steel rock
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_050_comb well it can do it for a little bit but it it can not do it for a very long time they attracted each other
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_066_comb you had to take either the compass a paper clip or the steel shavings and try use them to try to find it the compass would point north towards it so you could find it the paper clip you could feel it get heavier and with the shavings when you found it they would come up
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_044_comb they can attract through things that are th thin but not if not like thick cardboard so they could not g attract through something but they could attract through something that is thin like a piece of paper or something like that
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_040_comb wherever you put the magnet they will if they have the opposite sides they will come together and you can make em stay like tha
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_072_comb the paper clip you could find it and it would feel heavier and m on it because you would know that the magnet would be really by like you might be on the side of it and you will know we have been studying magnetism a lot of times it is steel or metal stuff
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_046_comb yes because cardboard thick cardboard it can go through thin cardboard but thick cardboard it can not go through they will depending upon how strong the magnet is yeah it comes together it it stuck on onto them a lot more when they looked newer the older ones did not stick t as well
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_006_comb we made them we found out what would come together with it and what would not they do not stick as well to other stuff and also the old shaving things also did not stick if they were all undone
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_064_comb we have put them in boxes and then took s steel shavings and a compass to try to find em that other people made cause the magnets were sticked stuck taped onto the box so you had to try to find it
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_042_comb since they attract they come through and they can sometimes depending upon how thick it is go through tables and other things it would point to the magnets so find and you could start going closer and it will point a different way after you get there towards the other magnet there was two magnets that you taped in
myst_997276_2008-01-12_00-00-00_ME_1.3_028_comb when they stuck together they would stay like that and you can move it around but if they did not stick they would the magnets on the nail that can make it a stronger to pick up the paper clip it is a lot stronger with the magnet on it if they did not stick they would not go anywhere if if you touched it and brought it up
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_005_comb today we took a motor and a battery and we tried to make the motor go then we took the motor and a battery with the switch and tried to make the switch turn on the motor and the battery it looked the same because of the light bulb is on
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_015_comb they have to touch it or else they will not know that it is there it does not have to be completely touching it but it has to be pretty near of it near it really by does not have to be exactly but it has to be touching it little bit by the battery
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_017_comb that is the switch turning the motor on by it is going by that that is hitting it to make the wire know that is there and then it goes to the battery and then that goes to the motor
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_029_comb and the light bulb can feel it coming through so it turns on and it goes down through there is another wire and it goes back and then it go to the next one and back to the battery
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_023_comb the motor does not really it goes the a different way so since the battery is flipped
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_027_comb the battery is there and the wire since it is connected to the light bulbs is going through is going to the light bulb
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_021_comb the motor is going from all of it the the battery has the two the of them that are connected to the motor which has them all connected and since they are all connected it makes the motor go
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_025_comb the battery pushes it to the motor no matter w way it going it will just go a different way is helping it but it is not the full thing
myst_997276_2008-11-12_00-00-00_ME_2.3_037_comb little things i forgot the name of them go through the wire in through them like do not go through them but kinda go against and kinda go through it feels kinda like when the motor starts to go we have been doing electricity i have to go goodbye
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_016_comb i had my partner hold the meter tape over here with his arms straight and then over here with his arms straight and his was exactly a meter to measure really big things or really small things
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_008_comb this table is exactly one meter and twenty-three centimeters or one hundred and twenty-three centimeters and it takes a whole meter to do do part of it but zero no you have some more so you can go on the centimeters part of that and to measure that
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_019_comb okay so we used my hand and from my wrist to to my to the tip of my pinkie it is about seven inches and for my pinkie nail is exactly a centimeter so i can use that to measure a meter but you would not want to use that to measure a one hundred pinkies
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_007_comb well you have to make sure your measuring tape is straight and it will be more easy to do any everything when you i forgot what i was going to say sorry
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_012_comb well this boy he is exactly one meter and with a he is probably a meter and ten inches i mean centimeters ten centimeters so with if he straightens this one out he will get the same thing cause he is like about one inch off
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_009_comb it will get you the best answer possible so if it begins at zero you have to end somewhere you can not just go on until you get to infi infinity so it has to land at for instance for this matter twenty-three w i am i am not exactly sure what a reference is
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_002_comb with like a meter or a ruler or a yard stick
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_011_comb it was important because we had to measure height because we had to line up up we had to know who the person who we were standing next to is height or else we would not be doing it we would not be in the right place in line so it was fun yet hard to do it
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_017_comb you can not bend a meter stick and you have to bend it to get around your head unless you are some super s person so it is impossible for you to do that so you will have to pick a meter tape
myst_996702_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_005_comb well first you will have to think there is a clock above me and the it is about i would say a foot and if i took a meter stick or or zero well it is like thirteen inches i know it would just yeah i did not really get to do any other body parts except for the ones i have told you you get a more precise estimate
myst_996702_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004_comb it got from fifteen to zero you have to mark the temperature and how long it took to get there and from this it took more than an hour it took an hour and a half to do this which is way longer than it should it goes up up all the way up it changed really quickly i guess
myst_996702_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_001_comb awesome i heard we are taking this is our last day actually so i am not really so psyched but goodbye to you after sh you could just count how much i guess by 5s or it got really colder it got twenty degree colder just by counting by 10s or fifty
myst_996702_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_005_comb one minute that is all it took from fifteen to goodbye i am really sorry to say this but goodbye it goes up because the ice is melting it goes up when it is hotter down when it is colder it got it was started at twenty and then it went to we drew it on graph paper it gets colder
myst_996702_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_023_comb how much time how much time it took to change i guess le x is or dots or things like that measurement and different units of measurement like temperature mass and campas and length you have to ch
myst_996702_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_033_comb it goes up if it is warmer and it goes down if it is hotter the not really hot ones are blue and the other ones are red i do not understand the temperature in the t well you put on it time and temperature they are different temperatures
myst_996702_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_011_comb wha sorry i am going to make you repeat things that help you estimate like your hand sometimes your feet sometimes well a lot of times your pinkie and thumb or your pinkie so those are a lot of the things that people usually use to measure things with a scientific guest
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_013_comb i noticed that as we got closer and c as we got as they got closer to it as we went up the the line of woods the decimeter got closer and by then the centimeter got closer and then until mil millimeter and that screwed up the whole thing
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_021_comb like say it was something two hands and that hand is ten inches well then your hand then you could go ten million, two hundred and one thousand and twenty and you would have a twenty inch thing well what our teacher says is use your pinkie for centimeters and your thumb and pinkie for a decimeters
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_030_comb say you were running a five k race like my friends that we just did a while ago and you were really slow you would have to practice running around that field around that field and it goes with the math you have to practice with that number with that number round and round and round and like this used to be really hard for me eight eight equals sixteen now we can do that very easily
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_007_comb how long a doorknob is from the floor it a cabinet shelf my classmate nick he is about as tall as a meter he is a little bit taller honestly i do not know
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_010_comb so it is something that the whole world agreed on that the whole u world uses so and the u s is the only people state that uses a different put a different unit of measur
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_026_comb well estimating is really with practice and i like to call it memory memory like the game cause you really have to remember the size of things cause we are not always going to have a paper in front of you to estimate with
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_025_comb well you can like i know what a pap how long a paper is so i can estimate a paper and if you have a book it is about the size of a paper but not exactly you can make a really go a logical guess
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_005_comb you would use it cause it would give you an exact it would give you the exact answer and it would not just make an estimate you would exactly know what this is how long the door knob is from the floor
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_011_comb you use it more because it has like two things that you use a lot like centimeters and meters meters are like really big things and you usually see a lot of big things and meter and centimeters excuse me for saying meters are actually pretty small and you see a lot of centimeters
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_022_comb it helps you with like well it is let me see how long this piece of paper is i am going to see it is one billion, twenty million, three hundred and four thousand and fifty centimeters fifty centimeters it is actually pretty easy to use your hand they are part of the metric system of the world they all start with one
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_003_comb meters are a one hundred centimeters meter is one kilometer and that is all i know meters are used in scientific study for like really long things or really short things and yeah
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_016_comb estimating is about a logical guess i always say but other people say well kind of like what i say a logical guess well this is an old saying practice makes perfect and i have to agree with it
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_017_comb it is probably not going to be perfect like yesterday we had to estimate about how long something was and then we had to really measure it and i only got a few times exactly right so it is kind of an estimate is not exactly what it is going to be but it you think that is what it is going to be and and it is by to that
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_033_comb like sometimes in contests they make you estimate you need to know the size how long this anaconda was for instance you would need to estimate the size of the anaconda
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_027_comb you have to measure it many many many times to just get the real answer cause maybe one time you measured wrong and maybe the other time you measure it right but you are not sure so you have to do it many times to make sure you get one answer
myst_996702_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_004_comb you can measure really big things or really small things and it makes a lot of sense to measure with centimeters if you are measuring like a water bottle or something you can know how much if you could know how much
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_013_comb i am i do not know if that it is the soaked sponge or wet sponge but it is definitely not i do not think it is dry sponge not much we have not done much work with sponges yet well not like cleaning up any messes or anything so yeah
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_029_comb mystery mystery is right there and circle it and then right here is weighing how much soap you have if you are not sure and you need it how much your baby weighs if it is small
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_019_comb i did not find out much i actually pretty much knew all that so cause it explained most of the stuff you did not really explain anything no offense or anything college professors
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_006_comb heavier than the dry sponge probably the mass would be s something all a little bit more than the sponge
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_023_comb well here is what we did so we weighed the dry sponge which was four grams for us and then we the wet sponge was forty-six and we subtracted four from forty-six which got us to a good sum four thousand, six hundred and forty-two the dry sponge is exactly three grams
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005_comb it is going to weigh a little more but not as much as the soaked sponge we have been studying different lengths and mass not so useful and it is probably not going to clean it
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009_comb well here is the one basic thing that sponges do clean up another thing that you could do with sponges is if you nee well this goes with the basic you could weigh how much water it had you are really s if you really really like
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_014_comb you put one gram piece two gram piece three gram piece four gram piece five gram piece one gram two gram three gram four gram five grams and say it was ten grams you you would have one hundred and ten gram piece am i right
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_008_comb the wet sponge is soaked so it is going to be heavier than the wet sponge heavier than the dry sponge because water like if you have ever had a towel and you try to sling it over your shoulder the first time it is easy when you do it the second time it is really hard because it is cause maybe it found the bathtub or the pool
myst_996702_2011-20-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_004_comb it is really dry and it is probably not going to weigh that much the numbers that the syringe holds it was really fun to scroll up i can not what is it is called but it is used for medicine and water and other things
myst_996702_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_005_comb well when you weigh the cup and so it was four grams and then you weigh the cup with the water and say it was sixty-five so you would subtract the grams of the cup which would be four so that would be sixty-one
myst_996702_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_024_comb cooking baking i have used that for a lot of things the cup and the water if you are measuring the cup with the water and then if you subtract the weight of the cup you are just weighing the water yeah
myst_996702_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_006_comb it might tell you how much you should have for lemonade and punch at a party which i am going to have one at tonight a party you could weigh the water it is a one thousand milliliters baking you need a precise amount of water evaporation test like that
myst_996702_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_023_comb small objects or liquid that is hard to explain sorry gram pieces another cup a lot of it is this thermometer is counting by 10s this is counting by ones and this is counting by 100s
myst_996702_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_026_comb small objects or liquid objects it is a minimum it is smaller than the meter measure gravel you can measure a lot of small objects with us into a milliliter i guess and a kiloliter or something
myst_996702_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_029_comb vial a measuring cup a measuring spoon number two is smaller than number one so it is probably going to hold less water it is not thicker so it is not going to hold more water so it is a one hundred and forty-two milliliters so you just take the water out of the cup i guess is what that is showing
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_028_comb well if something is taller but skinnier and if something is smaller but fatter they actually contain the same amount of whatever they are either taller but skinnier or smaller but wider
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_003_comb we had to figure out the how how much water water water could contain in a cup and it was actually really fun cause me and water my parents say i have a bad reputation but i just th think we have a messy reputation
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_016_comb well if you had like a stick and you put it in a stream and then you saw you could make an estimate on the wet line and the dry line so you could do that
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_015_comb probably like gravel like you want to put in a fish tank or liquid you want that you want to drink and you want to know how much and you want to have which is going to sound really weird coming from me but if you want seventy millime liters i do not know who would want that but maybe i would
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_007_comb i told you a lot a lot a lot of stuff but one other thing is that syringes can squirt medicine if you were really bad cold and you need to squirt it into the back of your throat you can use a syringe
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_006_comb syringe does not get you the precise cause it goes the precise th measurement cause it goes up to fis up to fifty but i think if you squirt the syringe into the graduated cylinder it will do it perfect
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012_comb it shows every ten milliliters it is it looks like a glass only as thinner and smaller probably and it has a little stand the s the space at the water or anything contains in a cup a beaker a graduated cylinder a what a all right a syringe
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_008_comb those are millimeters it does not matter whether it is taller or smaller it just matters how wide it i or how wide it is to make water precise measurements or any liquid or small object the space the water contains in the cup it will be filled to the brim
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_025_comb a beaker a syringe maybe not for gravel but for other thing and a graduated cylinder we can just use a syringe we can just pour the cup all sorts of different tools like a spoon or a straw but the straw it does not sound like a good idea to most people not even me
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_018_comb you could go a then b is double a b c is double b so on is fi is more than b and so on
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_030_comb they actually all hold the same amount of water but they are different sizes skinnier but taller wider but smaller skinnier but taller wider but smaller
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_032_comb m it is two graduated cylinders that and that is two hundred milliliters of water so and if you have a shorter but longer a shorter but wider one you could it would be two hundred milliliters could use a syringe you could buy a syringe if you did not have one and then you could go fill it up to
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_033_comb it is two hundred li milliliters still so it is the same amount if you turn it this way it is just as tall
myst_996702_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_014_comb probably things that we do not want a large amount of cause a one thousand milliliters is more than a one hundred milliliters and one millime liter is a lot less than one hundred or a one thousand
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_016_comb so you could go to another person take your straw and theirs would be taller or smaller and then you would know what had happened and our teacher did say that she checked us some of us felt kind of weird that our teacher had checked us we have been doing multiplication and division
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_009_comb yes and i am really excited to start well an easy way to use centimeters would be with a meter stick or a a ruler but the hard way would be to use inches if you had a ruler that did not measure or a meter stick that did not measure in centimeters
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_021_comb they were figured out cause everybody might have been using me like yards and feet and they and inches and they could not talk to other people in the on the globe so they probably created this just to make sure that everybody understood math the same way
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_015_comb we had to use straws to measure our desk and we had to not use anything but those straws so that is basically what we did and all of our answers came out different pretty much and that is because our straws were different lengths
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017_comb measurement standards are things that we use all over the world and everybody in the world if you say i want to measure this in centimeters will understand what you mean so it is basically what you use to measure in a big group they might come up with a decision to make a measurement standard
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_014_comb length is up and down or how tall lo my name is sarah i am really excited to do this with you so
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_003_comb i am really interested in what we are doing in science and sometimes i just feel like i really do not understand so i think that this is going to really help me and i am really excited to get started so i just want to really i just really want to do this okay
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_027_comb there are a lot of things i can say but the thing that i am going to say is that you could use a meter as like you could
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_019_comb you need to make sure that your straws are the same length group b is straws are shorter and group a is straws are much longer so you need to make sure that your straws are the same length to really do this problem
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_011_comb how long things are and how big they are you can measure you can s it is more likely that you would measure something big but sometimes you measure with the centimeters part of it and you measure something small
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_029_comb a meter has a one hundred centimeters i mean one hundred and it is used for very long objects or very short q how big it is it shows how long the meter is and how many centimeters are in a meter
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_023_comb you could use meters or you could use centimeters and that way you did it if an english kid did in shanghai people in shanghai would understand too i have got it to work
myst_996702_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_028_comb i noticed that the robot is hitting the floor and it hits just the middle line of the door knob on the door so the door knob is a meter above the floor zero everybody will get the same measurement so you know how many grams something is there is a one hundred grams in there and there is a one hundred grams in there
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_017_comb zero we did the sheet paper today you should use big big big ones cause the orange when you hold it it is heavy so i think you should use a lot 20s a lot of 10s and a lot of 5s but not so many ones
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_020_comb well here is there are two things you could do the hard way and get and buy more gram pieces or the easy way and if your dad has paper clips probably jumbos you could u balance those with some of them and you know the weight and then you know
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_026_comb it is a small gram i am guessing i did not say anything you have to know your calculations you have to know that that is one hundred grams
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_015_comb it is showing you how many gram blocks are compared to bigger gram blocks twenty is two is twenty-one grams 45s and one thousand and ten is one is 25s and ten grams and so on wood chip i am sorry for the pause big pause
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_014_comb well if you know how much a paper clip weighs then you can put your pencil in the balance zero i do not know how to explain my strategy i am sorry the standard units and also inches and feet
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_022_comb it is three hundred and twenty grams so three bags of one hundred and twenty and that is still a little off so you need a bit of five the standard measurement and a lot of other things
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_021_comb the gravel was a one hundred grams and there was only twenty million, four hundred and six thousand and eighty there was a one hundred grams in this but it was still heavier i i just do not get it
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018_comb you would get more prec even grams are a unit of actual measurement and so it would be much easier than putting a paper clip grams are a unit of mass of weight
myst_996702_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_007_comb they tell you how many grams are the wood chip which is three they tell you if i wanted to have a five gram piece of wood this would not and i thought zero this wood piece is the perfect one it would not be the perfect one cause the wood chip is only three grams
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_014_comb if you had a plastic if you did this at home and then she gave you these materials then you could figure it out pretty easily a one gram piece well you could weigh them with your hand or anywhere you need to think about what they are made of like the metal is probably going to be the heaviest
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_006_comb the plastic is pretty light cause plastic is re usually pretty light wood is sometimes pretty heavy but sometimes it is not so yeah
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_016_comb compares two objects say if you wanted to know what the pa how many pla paper clips would be heavier than that then you could use this too you wanted to know if a paper clip is heavier than a plastic disk then you could do that you would get completely different results
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_032_comb we can mes we could put like a cracker one and then one gram two gram three gram four gram and five gram so you ended at six grams and that is how much your cracker weighs
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_037_comb the more grams that go in the higher the other side gets the lower the other side gets and the higher the one with the metal disk gets we have been studying the standard system and other s systems has the same size paper clips
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_019_comb at first we used our hands to measure well my table group used their hands to measure the weight and we would say wow this is much heavier and zero the plastic disk is heavier than the wood tile
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_010_comb i if you put the on the same it is going to not measure how much they are you have to put them on different so you know how heavy they are
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_021_comb we used the paper clips like we used my table group used the small ones and then we would weigh those we would put one in the plastic disk and it was still then boom one more boom one more and that was it
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_008_comb it helped me order them cause i had some idea of how heavy they were like the washer and the plastic disk the washer is much heavier so my hand was going down as for the plastic it was going it stayed and same with the wood one paper clip equals one gram block
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_009_comb it is dropping them into it and the washer is much much heavier well if you knew that the washer was ten ounces then with and the plastic disk was one ounce and you did not know that you would not know that the washer was much much much much
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_026_comb groups group one is answers are t way more than group two because they probably had the smaller paper clips and group two had the jumbos two groups of paper clips one small paper clip and one big paper clip measurements more accurately than yeah
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_018_comb that the plastic disk is much lighter than the you know the i mean the plastic disk is much lighter than the washer everybody will get the same answer unless the objects are different sizes or weights s it is really hard to explain it is using a balance
myst_996702_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_027_comb we got different answers we got different results and we said the result and they said and other groups did not have that result they would say huh it is kind a funny
myst_996429_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_004_comb i have noticed that it is on a string and the weird thing is sometimes whenever it is on the string it just you would think it would go straight except it actually just whirls sort of the rubber band are mainly used for holding the pieces on and helping it go around and the importance about the fli the flight line is that
myst_996429_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_009_comb what makes it a plane system is that it is basically flying like a plane but it is basically just flying on a little line that you can barely see from far away and another thing that is similar to a plane is that the rubber band is basically the engine cause it is the one that helps turn the propeller
myst_996429_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_012_comb yeah it does that because well it helps the propeller spin and it basically is one of the things well the propeller makes the plane move and the thing that moves the propeller is the rubber band so well actually a problem that some groups have but i did not because i actually read the instructions some groups just did not even read the instructions and just went on and did it and they forgot about
myst_996429_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_015_comb rubber band and it just the propeller barely even spinned whenever i saw them well what would happen is the propeller thing would spin it up and make it all twirly and spinny and then the plane would just like spin
myst_996429_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_002_comb we have been graphing well we have been graphing and doing many things like we have been graphing and making planes the propeller moves mainly whenever you go back and forth whenever the wind pushes against them basically just chops the wind and it would turn up the rubber band
myst_996429_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_008_comb there are two types of straws one is super jumbo and one is just jumbo the one on the top that is actually on the string is this ju just jumbo the one is that are connected to the planes are super jumbo and we poked holes in the super jumbo because we needed something to make sure the plane could hang and it could go on the line
myst_996429_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_011_comb well the important thing about the flight line is that otherwise without that line it probably would not really fly it would just like stay on ground and the propeller probably would not even move that well so the line is actually pretty important and it helps the plane move across it
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_014_comb you use your graph for predicting you can predict the number of swings or you could predict how many swings for how many for how many inches or square feet the length of the pendulum is
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_007_comb the type of things that we put on the y axis are the number of swings so like whenever they are like you would put it there and then cross over to the length of the pendulum to see how long of swings and the number of swings for that amount of longness
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_015_comb well the x axis is the pendulum is length so whenever you do the length you would line it up with the number of swings like say you did twelve like twelve is like thirty-eight about so thirty-eight square feet or inches would be twelve swings
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_005_comb there are positioned in l form because then you can tell whenever the lines cross whenever the lines cross it will mean like how many numbers of swings in the pendulum is length we have been doing stuff like making pendulums and how they swing the kind of things that you can use are
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_003_comb the graph is about the number of swings it has and how long the pendulum is
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_008_comb the pendulum length on the x asik axis is when you put well you do not actually really put the string on there but you take what you would have on a piece of paper or something on to the pendulum pendulum length of well the x axis
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_004_comb one line is called the y the one is that is like straight up and down and the other line that is like across is called the x
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_006_comb the kind of information we put on the x axis is how long the pendulum is like if but the thing is you would have to put it between if it was forty something like between forty and fifty
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_017_comb what is happening is whenever it swings whenever it gets longer it has more to swing on so whenever it gets longer it has more to swing so it swings slower so like m slash x axis you could put like how long it is or how short it is or something like that
myst_996429_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_013_comb with the pendulum or how many did it already swing or something like that you would want to like not really change that much like you would just want to keep on because then you will go through the whole test and make sure that it is
myst_996429_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_007_comb what is important about changing one variable in a controlled experiment is you miss a lot of data if you change like say i changed two things like the length of the stick and like the length of the flipper and and the angle then you are missing how if you change the length of
myst_996429_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_025_comb well if you do that when well say you did it and then you forgot about that you could just do it again and or may be you might get different data let us say you messed up on a few of them you might want to do it another time the next day messed up with
myst_996429_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_010_comb it was about seeing how far the flipper or the cork would go well there is a flipper board you know like a little flipper box with a slit in it so then you would either push it in all the way or pull it out some just to measure it
myst_996429_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_011_comb we wanted to test how far the cork would go like if they are flat on the ground or at an angle
myst_996429_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_024_comb well you might get it to go up what i noticed in most of our experiments that as like angle on thirty then forty then fifty most of our experiments the distance would go farther up with it
myst_996429_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_014_comb i thought about the variables that we would change and i actually predicted that it would go farther and the person that i was working with she thought it that it was going to go like not as far it is like less except then it actually went far
myst_996429_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_004_comb well what made it a controlled experiment is well since we have changed the height it turned out that you could control how far it went and how high if you change that well the controlled things in my experiment are
myst_996429_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_012_comb changing one more variable variable is about like if you are wondering something you would change only one though because if you changed two then you would skip a lot of data
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_017_comb the increments in this data are like the variables of the winds and the numbers that the variables of the winds are the number of the passengers
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_005_comb mainly the x like the x line it is the number of passengers and the y is the how many how far it the plane went
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_011_comb well in passengers maybe i can see that four and like three quarters would be like the most amount on the line that it would go but then it would go farther down as the passengers went down
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_023_comb well mainly what happens is even though the motor would make it gain weight and make you would think it would slow down but the motor actually like spins or whatever it does makes it go faster
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_020_comb say if i had twenty except then if you counted by ones you would probably only go up to ten so i would count by 10s so then you would get to twenty and then eighteen or whatever you have
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_016_comb the number of winds changes by ten and the number of passengers is just like one so if you do it by 10s i would think that you for the distance you are probably going to have something in between the numbers
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_021_comb well mainly the data that we graph on i have noticed that everything that we add on or something would always make it go lower in weight so except maybe if we added a motor it would go faster only because there is well if i was graphing the things on the y axis i would
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_009_comb the information i find there is that x is motors of well of the motors that like the rubber bands and the y is how far the plane went with those motors
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_015_comb incremental change is mainly about like changing the variables on the thing that you are making like say you are making a plane and they change the weight by adding a paper clip or by adding a rock or something
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_014_comb well the axis goes up by one and whenever you say i added one passenger and then it had one thing but whenever you are making a graph you also have to take a note if i am counting by ones it is two hundred how am i going to get to two hundred so you also have to think about that
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_006_comb some dependent things are that well you have squares to help you know where it is like where to put the dots and how it occu how to connect them
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_013_comb i notice that they go up by ones and that that also tells me that it the highest that it would be able to go on is ten the line might tell you about the variables that whenever you add them it gets heavier or something like that and then it would just go down from eight hundred to like zero
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_010_comb we graphed them well we graphed them because to see how the plane went like say if there is more than one motor or something then it might go up or down we do not know just thinking about it but we know seeing it on a graph
myst_996429_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_004_comb this graph is about i think it is about mainly the planes that we have been making in science mation that is put on a graph is like if you tested something or for us like the planes the bottom we would meet up where the lines would meet for like say four passengers with seven we would meet where the lines meet
myst_996429_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_008_comb normally you change them like one at a time and then after that you can change normally you just change it one at a time because if you change more than one thing at a time then it would be well you will not to be getting through every experiment you will just be getting like skipping through some all the other kids with the pumped up kick
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-01-56_SRL_1.1_015_comb delta has some very very nice sand in the middle delta has a lot more sand than desert can you repeat that it was called soil i do not think soils are all the same cause if you look back at the other thing that you showed me there seemed to be a lot of different material
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-01-56_SRL_1.1_022_comb delta has very small grains in the middle while desert has more has bigger grains than mountains have bigger grains and farm lands has pretty small grains just not like super big or super tiny kind of normal grains my wife just died again
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-01-56_SRL_1.1_023_comb think they come from more sandy places like the desert has some sand at the top but it does not look like it was found in the middle of the desert cause if it was it would probably be all sand and stuff and then the delta seems to have lots of sand but the the mountains have a tiny bit of sand but farm lands is mostly just regular soil so stuff
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-01-56_SRL_1.1_013_comb i think that the delta mountain and farm lands have more organic carbon there is a lot of the properties of soil in that then cause it has silt clay hummus gravel and that stuff there is humus gravel clay and silt in it it tells me that there is humus gravel clay and silt in this soil
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-01-56_SRL_1.1_007_comb they said that there were there is those things in soil there is those things in soil can you please repeat that i notice that there is a lot of plant life like cacti and cacti and bushes and more cacti the farm land seems to have a lot of hay stuff on the top and top gravel stuff
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-01-56_SRL_1.1_019_comb they look like they have different materials it is made of lots of things depending on the area it is playing one of the mixture
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-23-30_MX_1.2_013_comb twenty grams twenty grams equals forty grams and then ten grams forty grams equals fifty grams so that equals up to the fifty grams if you combine them all together so on the right when with the equal side it shows all the up together equals fifty grams it is a solution i forgot the word for it it dissolves into it i forgot the word i do not want to talk about it
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-23-30_MX_1.2_025_comb it is a solution i think that it is a solution that no weight is added that no weight is lost when you add in that no weight to the salt is lost when you put in water by drying out the water so there is no much water left which i forgot the word for in a mixture i notice that the water disappears
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-23-30_MX_1.2_023_comb can you please repeat that it is important because then you got the solute think it is trying to make the color change and how it mixes in and you can not really see it as solid anymore it is a solution that even though the salt dissolved it still adds its weight please repeat that can you please repeat that can you please repeat that
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-23-30_MX_1.2_038_comb i forgot the word for it we have been learning about the flood cause the water is like floating up into the air and then the stuff is like staying on the bottom it tells me that the more that the weight that you add in adds to the weight so it adds to a total of sixty-five cause fifty fifteen equals sixty-five so that that means that it is sixty-five grams
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-23-30_MX_1.2_041_comb well then the solute is turned into crystals and then you got it out it is it is considered a solution the sand and water made the water all like misty and brown when the salt and water well the salt dissolved into it and kept its color
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-23-30_MX_1.2_010_comb the solution well the salt more dissolves into the water making salty water when the mixtures just kind of like mix in but you can still see the two differences with salt you can not really there is only small amounts of differences and it is a mixture
myst_012027_2014-03-17_10-23-30_MX_1.2_007_comb the salt will just blended into the water so if you drink it it is salty water it did not like disappear into an endless void it more just into water form it is a mixture the mass of the salt it is a mixture it is a solution can you please repeat that
myst_012027_2014-03-17_09-48-08_MX_1.1_007_comb the the pile on the left is all mixed in but the pile on the right is very organized it goes m and ms cashews and raisins
myst_012027_2014-03-17_09-48-08_MX_1.1_005_comb marbles trail mix salad water and some wood chips and paper clips i see that the marbles are in water and they are all in cups except for the salad and trail mix and that the salad tastes much better than the trail mix
myst_012027_2014-03-17_09-48-08_MX_1.1_029_comb salt we call the solid material salt wife just died salad is much better than trail mix the salt will get dissolved and the water will get bigger the most important thing is that your food is moving but the second important thing is that they are all in little colonies
myst_012027_2014-03-17_09-48-08_MX_1.1_032_comb mixtures is what you mix something solutions is when you get something we know that it can be separated if we just evaporate the water the salt is become very small and well if you see the water rises a little bit when you put the salt in yeah some of them are solid more solid than others
myst_012027_2014-03-17_09-48-08_MX_1.1_020_comb the water is filtering mixtures did not change but the filters did because the mixtures used be sand and water but now it is and but now the water is down to the bottom cause we used a coffee filter instead of a regular filter a screen filter water is filtering mother was a type writer and your dad was a smart phone
myst_012027_2014-03-17_09-48-08_MX_1.1_016_comb water is going into the bowl but the marbles are staying on top on the filter all of the food different food material stuff is separating into piles the it is the water is being filtered they put a filter in the bowl and poured the water through and left the marbles on the outside
myst_012027_2014-03-17_09-48-08_MX_1.1_018_comb it is important because the water was filtered and the sand stayed in the coffee filter because there are little animals in your food well because the water has already dissolved into the the grape mix has already dissolved into the the water so hi gauge i do not know what do they do have to
myst_996228_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_064_comb i thought it would be like one hundred and nine something like that they are not as heavy but if you put like a kilogram which is like one thousand grams then you could measure by kila measure weight with kilograms maybe well we took we were measuring how much water a sponge could hold becau if it was something really heavy you would use a kilogram
myst_996228_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_058_comb the water in the sponge the kilogram is one thousand grams we we get a r dry sponge and then we put it in one of the plastic cups and then we measure it by grams maybe one or two maybe laptop computer a bag something like that
myst_996228_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_034_comb we fill it up we fill the sponge up with water let it drip all the extra water out and then put the wet sponge in the other c in the cup until and then when it gets level that is when you know when to stop then you count how many grams were in the other cup and that is how many grams it weighs
myst_996228_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_006_comb well first we measured the dry sponge so that we knew how much to to subtract and then and from the wet sponge and then we took the wet sponge and put it in and then it was like ten or something like that and we would subtract like two or how much the dry sponge was
myst_996228_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_022_comb level means that this little bar is lined up with this thingie no maybe one more the water is filling up the pockets that is about as good as we can get it is a balance an empty water bottle or something
myst_996228_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012_comb it went well but some of our sponges were different sizes because they were cut out from a bigger sponge so we did not all get the same answer measuring with grams how can i put that well y they are grams are like this big and you put them in the other cup one by one so
myst_996228_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_026_comb if you put like five in at once maybe it is too heavy unless it is like a heavy item like say sixteen grams but the how much water we can hold in the sponge is thirteen cause we subtracted three from the dry sponge
myst_996228_2009-08-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_038_comb the wet the wet sponge doctor weighs more cause there is more stuff added to it like liquid so it is a lot heavier more definitely more because it has water in it
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_040_comb our the the other our other science lesson we had about water was i think last year in two thousand and eight and we took the graduated cylinder instead of the syringe and we put it into the container instead i think we are finished
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_030_comb no we we had twenty-five in our graduated cylinder and then two hundred in the container no we had well i think the well this one counts by 10s instead of 5s so it is not the most it is not it is not as efficient as our one that we were working with in class
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_024_comb a syringe that would would like connect to the connect in so it would ho it would like snap into the cup then you would pull the water out maybe you would pull and you would accidentally be pulling the syringe out and you would not get as much water so well then we had the i can not remember what it was called
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_028_comb we we had to pull it up to fifty milliliters and then w with the extra water we would squirt it into the graduated cylinder and then it we got it up to five so no wait we got it up to twenty-five so we counted that twenty-five with our twenty thousand, two hundred and twenty-five then my dad flew me home he ha he used to have a job in california
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_008_comb zero yeah milliliters and we figured out that there was one hundred and well wait twenty thousand, two hundred and forty-five milliliters and then we filled it up to a so it was not that much and we got fifty-three there is a big difference between that so
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_048_comb this our container did not have like ten thousand, nine hundred stuff like that
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_010_comb if there was any extra water we would suck it up with the syringe and then push it into the graduated cylinder instead of into the into the container and th and they both held the same thing but the graduated cylinder was a little bit easier to tell so
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_042_comb well i can not really tell the difference we we put it into the container until there was no more water in the cup and then we would count like this se we would pull up with the syringe and then push into the in the container and say five thousand, one hundred huh
myst_996228_2009-15-01_00-00-00_MS_3.3_044_comb well yeah what you said was what happened i just can not repeat it all it was not the most efficient way but still it was the best you could get with school stuff well it is a measuring thing it measure it measures what is heavier than the other
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_034_comb if we use well it is not very efficient to use paces and big steps than using measuring items so if you are talking about centimeters and decimeters decimeters is ten centimeters
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_056_comb but i get it like twenty is 210s 210s equals 45s 45s equals forty wu equals 21s this looks like a meter tape yeah meters so there is one hundred centimeters in a meter right we just measured things with meter tapes and stuff like that
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_004_comb like with meters and centimeters and inches and feet and stuff like that
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_044_comb s i would say so if you are talking something like this then you can measure the cup with nothing and with something with something and you know that the one with something is going to be lower because it is heavier
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_060_comb well one of them is straight up and one of them is kinda wobbly so you do not measure it the correct way
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_040_comb because if you use one of your units of measurement you c your friend can be like okay it is one meter long and half a meter wide and then you can actually measure that with something more efficient like a meter tape
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_080_comb when the paper clips got put in to measure the same as the chip we did not but it was the most interesting here that you can mes that you can make it that you can make them the same by putting maybe something lighter but you can use more than one of those lighter things i do not really know
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_024_comb okay and we always use and we also use body benchmarks so if we like do not have a ruler i can tell like what is an inch what is a foot and what like that stuff like that no not really yeah you put em you put that one on top of that one and then you put things in these and then you ba try to balance them out
myst_996228_2008-04-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_066_comb millimeters can not really remember what those are but well it was a long time ago but i think i can remember how many big steps it took wider than table than tables are high not that i remember
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_009_comb well we are trying to figure out how how much how much water a sponge can hold in grams so maybe yeah it may be more than one kilogram
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_131_comb because well if you are talking about length usually it is like meter like one meter two meter stuff like that and this one you say gram gram meter texas from here maybe something like that
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_133_comb when we use meter is like so there are two cups in each side and you put your the item in one side and then you put the grams in the other side and you put in one gram at a time and if you get up to five grams you can put in a five gram piece or something like that yeah
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_063_comb twenty grams i think twenty-one grams of water wait twenty-four grams of water yeah because then if you put in like a twenty it can go like thunk or something like that well well you do you have a picture of it maybe the length from and then you put them put the grams in one by one again
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_023_comb well you are looking for until it is perfectly leveled because it may be too much it can get messy in the balance and then you measure it out with the grams
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_015_comb and so we take the dry sponge and we put it in first and then we measured that out so we know how much to subtract from from the s s and then we maybe a little heavy the bigger s the big sponge would hold more water and it would weigh more when it is dry
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_059_comb so when you are measuring it out with the grams then when it is perfectly leveled you subtract one or two of the grams from the sponge so then you know that is how much water like a kilometer is one thousand meters how much water is in that a dry sponge can hold
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_143_comb centimeters these are about a centimeter long which is amazing yeah if i had anything at my disposal i would use a probably when you are doing like maybe a yogo or something
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_051_comb and then you take a five and then another five and if it is too heavy when you put in the n another five you would take the five out and put in four little gram pieces then take something lighter than an orange i do not know so say when i put the dry sponge in it is like this and another gram then another gram then another gram and now it is pretty balanced right you you take out the grams one by one and count them it tells you how much to subtract from the wet sponge
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_007_comb because they have these little holes and they are squishy so you put em in the water and they absorb the water and and then they get bigger and then and then you and then you squeeze the water well when you are measuring it you squeeze you put you put the dry sponge in first and measured that
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_031_comb well when you have the wet sponge you weigh it until it is full and you know h that it is full when it when it stops getting bigger because maybe they they were cut unevenly i have no idea really i have no idea no it was well it was cut out from a bigger sponge so so we a all our tables got different answers
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_005_comb sponges sponges they soak up water they help you clean stuff not very heavy milligra i think there is these things called milligrams i can not remember but they are something bigger than a kilogram zero yeah
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_035_comb you wait and so you put the dry sponge in the water and you wait until it gets as big as it can and then you take it out that it is filled with water and then you take it out and it drips a little bit so you let it drip then you put it in the in the side and it is ab an estimate is just guessing grams are measuring tools
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_049_comb yeah but if it is if it is too if it is like an heavy item you can go by 5s or something like that no not really you just look at it and guess well the soaked one would definitely be the most the dry one would definitely be the lightest and then and then the wet one would be just in the middle
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_077_comb so if it is dry it is not going to be very big wet it is going to be a little bigger and soaked it is going to be gigantic it is extra water the dry sponge when we measured it it measured about one or two grams can not really remember i do not know really i do not know
myst_996228_2008-15-12_00-00-00_MS_2.3_013_comb and measuring anything no measuring how heavy it is grams well there is different sizes of grams there are one grams which are bi about this big five grams which are about this big and then ten grams which are about this big this big the solar cell will not absorb energy from the sun and it would stop
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_010_comb cause it is not a full complete circuit wires are connecting to the d cell going over connecting to the motor making the motor run and it is going to a through a through a circuit
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_006_comb what must happen is energy must go through the wires going through a circuit going to the motor making it the flag go to your we have been learning circuits and how they work and to make how to make a full circuit
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_009_comb the energy was not connecting to the other wire making it going to making it not going to a complete circuit making it not move or do anything like that but now that the wire now that the switch has been connected it is going again because it is a complete circuit now the the important thing about that is that the energy is going through the wires to the motor the solar cell has to be connected to wires facing the sun
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_016_comb cell is facing the sun making the suns energy connect through connect through to the to the solar to the solar cell making the energy go through the wires to the motor making it go i notice that it is the energy is going through a circuit going to the motor making it run
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_027_comb is showing that that the energy is going through the wires both wires making a circuit making the energy making the energy reuse itself going to the wire making it keep going forever and ever unless you move a wire
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_015_comb if you do not want to waste a battery you can out in the sun and then it will get and then it will get energy from the sun if it is connected to the wire the energy will flow through the wire to whatever you want to build it from when the switch is open it does not it does not flow the energy does not flow through to the motor making it not connect and making it not go
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_026_comb what is not happening in the circuit is energy i notice that it is not going
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_011_comb a complete circuit so you have to push the switch back because the energy has connected to that thing that the wires connected to with the switch and the switch has to connect to the other wire or metal so the energy is connected to the metal so it will go through to make a complete circuit going lighting up the motor exactly what you said or whatever
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_012_comb i notice that when the wire is connected to that other metal connected to the wire it goes but when it is not and it is separated it does not go means the the solar cell is connecting with the suns energy absorbing it making it go through the wires to the motor
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_022_comb if the sun is out then there is energy flowing from the sun to the solar cell making it light up the flag is spinning and it is important and it is important because then you know if the energy is actually going through or not
myst_004029_2013-11-19_09-44-50_EE_1.2_024_comb that makes the energy go through the wires making it go to the motor making it have energy making it go that the flag is moving this is about the switches going so it you can actually turn it off and on without moving the wires
myst_004029_2013-12-17_09-34-22_EE_2.2_006_comb i think that because it is and stuff noticed that energy is flowing into and it is creating a circuit i think the circuit would be best for parallel circuit
myst_004029_2013-12-17_09-34-22_EE_2.2_023_comb i notice that when it is disconnected it is going but when it isn t connected it is going for some reason i forgot your questions anyway so i think i m right i noticed that the bulbs are lighting in very radical way could you say that again yeah this is the cat clock
myst_004029_2013-12-17_09-34-22_EE_2.2_014_comb that i do not know they are lighting with only d cell and that would is very complicated to me this is parallel circuit okay i don t know the paths are going in a no it is that is it going through and making a circuit that is very bad
myst_004029_2013-12-17_09-34-22_EE_2.2_019_comb it goes back into the positive side and the negative side it is going around and it is a circuit and it is lighting up the both bulbs with one d cell and we did this in class and the stuff they are flying in a circuit and there are energy
myst_004029_2013-12-17_09-34-22_EE_2.2_007_comb i noticed that is that is a circuits yeah a very good circuit could you repeat that again i see that the flame is producing heat and the stored energy from the wax is going to the wick going it going to the flame making it light but it is giving but the wax is giving away energy
myst_004029_2013-12-03_09-52-03_EE_1.4_006_comb we observed that it is melting because of the heat and wax is melt it will come from the sun to the solar panel so the solar energy cell and it will go through that transferring it to the wires going to the motor making it go
myst_004029_2013-12-03_09-52-03_EE_1.4_018_comb i see wood wood gives fire so well the candle the food the apples is stored energy the candle produces heat so does the wood and the oil makes more fire pretty much becomes polluted i think unless it is solar powered car
myst_004029_2013-12-03_09-52-03_EE_1.4_002_comb we have been learning about connections and how and because it is producing heat which is the energy making it flow also we know it is actually energy and some other thing okay can we skip this and is producing it off giving it energy and the sound is the energy
myst_004029_2013-12-03_09-52-03_EE_1.4_005_comb important because of we didn t have energy we wouldn t have lighter anything or any like that and we wouldn t have the universe because the universe is made out of energy it will pollute the air using energy because she is walking going on a but she s also producing energy because the apple has energy in it say that again
myst_004029_2013-12-03_09-52-03_EE_1.4_027_comb it is only one time use and coal is just and coal it s can stay there for a little bit long time well burn to fire i see a candle wick burning and there are is a flame on candle wick and then the wad below it is melting it didn t sound like anything is burning and flaming in heat
myst_004029_2013-12-03_09-52-03_EE_1.4_013_comb energy is being produced out by the sound because it is being vibrated and some energy is the sound can hear sound because of that great that is why it was not working because it didn t hit the switch get it how can i put them together please tell me
myst_004029_2014-02-10_14-24-49_EE_4.1_008_comb i did not say that at all i did say that at all hahaha what is all about then something will happen i guarantee it nathan did it david s david is flirting with a girl it is not a magnet any more zero my gosh magnetic force magnets
myst_004029_2014-02-10_14-24-49_EE_4.1_017_comb let take us no i just do this and then you and then you swipe my hand you do not even turn to do it it goes to the attic the nail is made out of steel and iron making it stick to the magnet but the wood is not so yeah
myst_004029_2014-01-22_09-22-19_EE_3.1_003_comb i noticed that the magnet the two magnets have a north and south side which will red and white and that they are sticking to the fridge which is magnetic for iron and metallic item is well one is aluminum and one is made out of steel and iron the end it is made out of iron and steel but the other one is made out of aluminum which will not stick
myst_004029_2014-01-22_09-22-19_EE_3.1_023_comb steel and iron and other magnets and super conductors they have iron the i don t know but i don t want really have time for this please let me hurry up
myst_004029_2014-01-22_09-22-19_EE_3.1_009_comb wood tin well paper cabinet maybe and plastic the aluminum nail is not sticking because it s not part of the
myst_004029_2014-01-22_09-22-19_EE_3.1_012_comb well you see the wood does not have any iron or steel and any other magnet so super conductors so will not stick i think the objects that that s that have been sticking have the metallic items that makes it stick to the magnet
myst_004029_2014-01-22_09-22-19_EE_3.1_004_comb they only stick to metallic items such as metals steel and iron but not aluminum or other stuff they only stick to
myst_004029_2014-01-22_09-22-19_EE_3.1_013_comb wood block doesn t because it doesn t have any other it doesn t have any other magnet or any iron or steel and it doesn t have a super conductor but the nail does have iron and steel i said that a lot
myst_004029_2014-01-22_09-22-19_EE_3.1_005_comb because the refrigerator is iron and steel and they like to stick to metal and steel because the nail is made out of steel and iron super conductors metal and iron and other magnet it s south and south and north and north
myst_004029_2014-01-24_09-55-35_EE_3.2_012_comb the pole attracts the north side of the compass and the south pole attracts the south side of the compass because we have because the north we because the north pole and the south pole are connect are generating magnetic fields to protect us from the sun is solar flares some are repelling and some are attracting the end end of the story i learned a lot thank you very much
myst_004029_2014-01-24_09-55-35_EE_3.2_006_comb the magnets are repelling each other because we switched the sides around south and south or north and north can t go together which is i think you re smarter than this you re an adult we have been learning they are very medic and very metallic a person with a compass
myst_004029_2014-01-24_09-55-35_EE_3.2_008_comb north and north are repelling south and south are repelling north and south attract south and north attract the end of the story i learned a lot than you much good bye it s the parts of the circuits other circuit that is energy flowing back around through the d cell like it is every using the energy making it move through the d cell
myst_004029_2013-12-02_10-21-41_EE_1.3_010_comb the motor is not running because the popsicle will well the stick is not metal noticed that they are popsicle stick is not metal and it is wood so the energy can flow through that so the motor is not running
myst_004029_2013-12-02_10-21-41_EE_1.3_007_comb i observed that the paper clip is metal and that since metal it the energy is flow like through and going to the motor yeah pretty well it has to do with it because it is not metal making the energy not flow through it you just established that different because they aren t made of metal the metal or copper or steel good how about you
myst_004029_2013-12-02_10-21-41_EE_1.3_015_comb insulators because they are not made out of metal metal
myst_004029_2013-12-02_10-21-41_EE_1.3_003_comb the d cell battery has a wire through the left side going to the lever the lever is open but the nail is there and its metal so the energy can go through going to the other wire going to the other wire connecting to the motor making it go and then the right side is just the wire going to the motor
myst_004029_2013-12-02_10-21-41_EE_1.3_002_comb we have been learning about other metal objects that have been that can connect energy to wind energy source they are conductors because they are made out of metal and energy can flow through metal they are insulators because they re not made out of metal and energy cannot flow through them the energy is going through the paperclip because the paperclip is metal
myst_004029_2013-12-02_10-21-41_EE_1.3_012_comb matters because if it s metal then it needs to be it can it is a magnetic field and it attract metal things to magnets because we learned that in science it is magnetism going through the table because they opposite poles and opposite poles attract
myst_004029_2014-01-28_08-22-37_EE_3.3_010_comb the thick stack would not but the think stack would because it s easier for magnets to magnitude it is hard for the magnetism to go through because the paper is thick metal and magnetism on a magnet
myst_004029_2014-01-28_08-22-37_EE_3.3_021_comb it would not be magnetism that no more long and stuff because of the magnetism i do not know it is happening the magnetism is traveling through the steel nail and when you remove the magnets the magnetism is still on the steel nail making the paperclips stick
myst_004029_2014-01-28_08-22-37_EE_3.3_025_comb the flow of magnetism is going to because there is like do not know do not care they are both magnets it is not sticking my mind is blown by mystery i observed that the spacers are like preventing the magnetic field you know
myst_004029_2014-02-03_09-47-48_EE_3.4_005_comb there are washers in the other cup that are trying to pull away the magnetic force of the two magnets move i observed both i notice that it flipped around like this tell you more about what i think i never mind i notice that it is lighting up of course
myst_004029_2013-11-18_09-03-05_EE_1.1_010_comb light bulbs are so you can see that the energy got there and you can see stuff it flows by going through the wires going to the casing of the bulb and there is another one connected to the bottom of the bulb going out to the positive side making the bulb have a circuit lighting it up
myst_004029_2013-11-18_09-03-05_EE_1.1_024_comb think that it will not light up because there needs one to be at the side of the bulb for the energy to flow out cause if it is at the bottom then there is only just one bulb connecting to it or i mean wire saves the energy to light it up be connected to make the energy flow through the wires so the to so the light bulbs can
myst_004029_2013-11-18_09-03-05_EE_1.1_007_comb is a pathway for the energy to go through so so you can see the light bulb light the negativity side they help the energy go through the d cell so the bulb can actually light up kinetic energy and then closed circuit i notice that it is making the light bulb light up
myst_004029_2013-11-18_09-03-05_EE_1.1_004_comb are so you can power your device or light bulb so it will light up or show you that the energy got there have been learning about wires and kinetic energy i am really good how about you
myst_004029_2013-11-18_09-03-05_EE_1.1_014_comb is flowing through the d cell positive side and going out the negative side into the bulb but it is coming out the bulb again into the positive side making it a circuit i see a circuit you can use a hand or you could use a ruler or you can use your pinkie
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_018_comb well it is measuring how long your from ten from your left arm to your right arm and you can measure and that is what arm span is well a hand is ten is ten in ten inches long and i mean ten centimeters long and you can use my hands cause you can tell that it is ten centimeters
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_021_comb a pinkie finger is about one centimeter long th i mean tall wide and tall wide wide i mean and if you always measure with your pinkie you would always get a centimeter
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_024_comb i measured my head my biceps my ears my fingers my foot my legs my arms and all over my body except for my eyes and my lips
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_022_comb well the width is one centimeter long i am predicting and and i forgot the rest you can use centimeters or inches well you would need a meter stick or a yard stick to do this or a tape measure and the reason you would use those is because they are bigger than rulers and that is how you can measure a classmate
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_029_comb you can find them on yard sticks i think i mean meter sticks and rulers i do not know
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_017_comb you can take a yard stick or a meter stick and you can measure arm span and you can also use a tape measure and you can cause they are a little bit longer some of them can be a little bit longer and you can use them to measure your arm span
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_020_comb you would need to think about how wide it would be how tall it would be and how long it would be and the most important thing is you are very pretty you should always start at a corner and it will always get you where you need
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_023_comb your foot is very useful because it could be like a few inches or a few centimeters if you count it and i do not know how many centimeters or something it is but it is very important to use feet cause a lot of people say feet instead of hands or pinkies it is bigger than a ruler and that is why they are most most more common
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_014_comb well the reason why you should measure more than once is cause your answer should is not always going to be the same as the first time maybe but if it is the same then you are probably correct you should keep doing it until like three or two times until you if you get the same answer then it could be correct
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_013_comb because your answer might not always be right or correct beca it could mess up and you that is why you should measure more than once well if you count the lines you can count ten each so that would equal and then you can know that is always ten centimeters but that was not a half so you could tell
myst_996700_2011-13-01_00-00-00_MS_1.3_016_comb i measured my foot the size of my neck and the ear the the nose and we measured how tall we are and our arm span was er what was important is to learn centimeters inches millimeters yards and feet it is a table
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_033_comb well you could probably get the same answer well the paper clip is one gram the coin is five grams the whole bunch of paper clips are ten grams and the whole bunch of coins are fifty grams
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_025_comb it took two hundred i mean three hundred and twenty-five grams to to to keep it balanced to get the orange to balance i do not even know what reference is or what it me very good thank you
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_032_comb well yours might be not right if everybody is is the same because you could check again and then you could get kilograms like if somebody is has like two kilograms and i had one kilogram that means i missed something i do not know what grams are all about i do not know a one thousand grams equals one kilogram
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_018_comb these are grams please repeat it well a kilogram i do not very kn i do not really know much of a kilogram i just i just heard of the word kilogram really we have not really talked about kilograms in class
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_009_comb zero well i am a little shot today so i am sorry but it is balanced and you want to keep something balanced if you want to know how much it is in grams centimeters
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_028_comb well funny you should ask but between you and me i love you so kilograms is like a one thousand kilograms is 1000s and 1000s and 1000s of pieces of grams and i forgot my and i forgot and i am making a lame excuse
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_012_comb i do not between you and me i do not know sorry well an probably an apple would be lighter and an orange would be heavier and you take the grams and you put them into the cup okay you put an orange or an apple or something you put something in one cup and then you put s and then you put the grams in the other cup and see if it will balance
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_024_comb the orange is too heavy and so you will need more grams to to make it balance it is eight grams well in class we measured a pencil and it turned out it was five grams
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_008_comb three grams three little cute black say equals three grams equals one gram each which is there is thirty-three grams is measuring is balancing the wooden chippy thingy i do not i do not i am scared i am sorry it takes seventy grams to fit that toy c to measure that toy car and keep it nice and balanced i do not know
myst_996700_2011-19-01_00-00-00_MS_2.2_029_comb when something is very heavy and you use more than a one thousand it is one kilogram well my rug at home is as long as a meter because i have measured it with a meter stick well actually my mother is rug because she is the teacher you can use your hands or your feet that is why they call it a big foot or a little hand it is ten centimeters on in this picture
myst_996700_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_003_comb we have been measuring and we have been using and we have been using measurements and length and we have been weighing stuff when you estimate it is very important cause you do not really want to know everything it is kind of like a guess only you want to get to the closest number there like in a jar you have to ask me how many jelly beans
myst_996700_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_006_comb well a meter stick is longer than straws and they have numbers on them so if you are lining up correctly you can get your length that you really want to show that length you could do wide or high you can do the length or the width and you can zero shoot i just forgot
myst_996700_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_022_comb you can measure with them even with a ruler the metric system i do not know that question i i forgot the question so i do not know right now so sorry i do not know and i do not like you
myst_996700_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_019_comb you can use a meter stick because it is kind of very long it is bigger than a ruler like every time you measure with a meter stick you can you can get bigger amounts with big things i do not know so you can measure things that are bigger than rulers
myst_996700_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_018_comb you can measure and you can measure the width or how long it is all those hands it is fifty centimeters all in all we have been measuring a doorknob mean a a knob on a door
myst_996700_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_024_comb because you can measure a lot of things without measuring you could very well just not know anything on how to measure so we need measuring a lot that is why we measure and that is what we have been studying a little bit in school you can all measure with them and they are all measuring tools that you can always use when you need them
myst_996700_2011-12-01_00-00-00_MS_1.2_030_comb it is almost to like an inch or centimeters like ten centimeters your pinkie is and a hand is ten is fifty centimeters i think well it is going heavy light light light little you can weigh them with a scale i do not know the answer to that question
myst_996700_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_024_comb because the scale can tell if it is heavy or not and your hands they have lots of muscles so they do not and they can just go flapping any way they want i do not know i do not know well if something is not balanced you can use paper clips and see then you make it measure the so it is in the middle
myst_996700_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_033_comb the little cube in front of me and it equals one gram what i got it class was we had to use five grams to measure eight i mean two grams to measure a chip i do not know well the picture showed me that that the metal washer was h the heaviest and then these are paper clips i do not know
myst_996700_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_020_comb it is balanced because there are i forgot i do not know i do not know on seven million, six hundred and fifty-four thousand, three hundred and twenty-one then the metal washer gets heavier in grams well small paper clip would you would have to put more and a big paper clip you would have to use less
myst_996700_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_034_comb you can do like one gram two grams three grams four grams all the way until infinity well they probably would not get the same results because one is heaviest and one is not heaviest well in class we used a weighing tool and the and to get them balanced we had to use four paper clips to get it balanced
myst_996700_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_035_comb i do not really know the answer to that question the metal washer is heavier than the chip because that is the best way to balance it and then you can get it to do something
myst_996700_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_021_comb well the chip is very light and then if there was nothing on the other cup there would then the chip would be the heaviest but they add paper clips in it and then they see how much it weighs and then it can be balanced well the fir the heaviest would be the magnet maybe then the then the wooden then the wood block and then the chip
myst_996700_2011-14-01_00-00-00_MS_2.1_038_comb in this picture it takes eight grams to fill that metal washer liters are something that you can do something with and it can measure how much something can weigh or how high it could possibly hold i forgot what this is i do not know
myst_996700_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_022_comb well the skinny one can hold a one hundred milliliters and the big tubie thingy can hold a one thousand milliliters one is skinny and one is very fat it can hold different amounts of things that you need what we have been doing is we have been measuring when you bake a cake you can use milliliters i do not know that answer
myst_996700_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_036_comb well you would pull the tu black thing out it takes ten little tubies to fill to make a one thousand milliliters because you can get different results because they are bigger cause they are bigger and you can get different results that way a millimeter is bigger and a liter is smaller well it can tell you how how much water it can hold or how much it can
myst_996700_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_032_comb you could use a measuring cup because it has a few inches millimeters or liters a liter can be broken down like if you can have like like if you had a measuring cup you could break down like five or as many liters as you want to make a cake or something like a cupcake or a cake pop tart or something
myst_996700_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_010_comb well vial two could hold less and vial one could hold more like twice that much of vial two
myst_996700_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_027_comb the big tube the big tube ha can have four milliliters and i mean it takes forty-four of those to fill up eight hundred and eighty-eight millimeters and it takes nine in the second vial to it takes nine to make eighty-eight milliliters because one is big and one is small
myst_996700_2011-21-01_00-00-00_MS_3.1_020_comb that shows us one milliliter well these are lines that that can probably tell you how much it can probably hold well it could be used for science well i do not know i have to find that out the cup on the left has more than the cup on the right te we could take water and then you could pull it up we have been weighing a lot of things
myst_996700_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_012_comb the lines represent how many it holds when we predict you could make an estimate and make a line and see if it will go over or under well it took away well it took away mark see
myst_996700_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_017_comb a graduated cylinder would kind of be like get a pie one will be a bigger pie and really a small pie well they could all hold the same amount of water s they could probably all hold the same thing it could just be higher fatter skinnier and they could just all hold the same thing i do not know what i am observing i do not know what capacity is
myst_996700_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_016_comb well there is more graduated cylinders that are fatter and they can equal a one thousand milliliters it is a graduated cylinder you can measure water in or liquids in it can show how much it can take how much it will hold but it will eventually stop at fifty milliliters i do not know what capacity is at all
myst_996700_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_014_comb i think it can hold water except this one can hold one hundred milliliters i do not know what capacity is we have not even studied about capacity i do not know put water in it it could hold fifty milliliters fill up a cup with it i do not know you would put the water in the syringe and we would spray it into something to see how much it is capacity is where you put a c water in a container and you fill it up and it is capacity
myst_996700_2011-25-01_00-00-00_MS_3.2_020_comb estimating is where you can you can est i do not get the question and tall and s and ten small straws long and wide it is where you can use a ruler a yardstick or something to weigh and you can find out how long or wide it is
myst_996700_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_013_comb i do not know that question i think it is really fun and there is different types of straws like you can cut and you can measure a lot of different sizes with straws a little bit hi hi my name is catherine and i am nine years old will you tell me a question i got it to work
myst_996700_2011-11-01_00-00-00_MS_1.1_017_comb well i do not know well every single minute the temperature dropped with the with the cup with the ice in it well it would probably be at four zero well the water gets colder and the temperature drops
myst_996700_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016_comb well every single minute we well actually we put ice well actually we got some warm water and we put it in a cup and we put ice in it and then every minute we checked the thermometer and see what the temperature wa well we did every minute we would check our thermometer and see what are thing were it goes up governor and it goes down
myst_996700_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_041_comb one of them says five hundred and fifty-one of them says a one hundred and one of them says fifty-one of them says twen well it show me that is cold and it can tell the temperature of it well at start it was at twenty celsius and then at the finish it was below zero it was zero celsius
myst_996700_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_043_comb it is called milleria and when it get hotter it goes up it says fifteen celsi we observed ten minutes well when we call them and if the and if the thermometer breaks you can die from it the liquid that is inside a thermometer i do not know
myst_996700_2011-28-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_037_comb well you should and then if you count your way up to where the thermo i do not know i forgot well when it gets hotter it gets gas in it and that makes the red stuff go up i forgot dang it the temperature drop well we looked at the thermometer and it ha it goes up and it goes they are ice they are salt crystals i can tell they have different variables it is a chart
myst_014014_2014-01-28_12-46-00_MX_3.2_004_comb that difference is you put four scoops of citric acid and six scoops of sugar you can see what the description is of the crystals and match them together you check on the crystal identification chart the difference is there is residue substance c is twelve grams we have been learning about saturation what i think was happening was the salt was dissolving and then you put it you filtered it and weighed it on the scale
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_028_comb a mixture is like candy mixed with nuts but a solution a solution has two things that are going to be mixed together and they just they create a liquid or
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_005_comb what i realize marni is the well the first one has nuts raisins and m ms and they are just altogether but the next one has the peanuts separate the raisins separate and the m ms separate it is not a mixture yet the screen is catching the sand it is important because they are all changing to different groups
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_018_comb the difference is that the salt will just totally dissolve in the water you just can not see it but it is still there and then you know the one with the paper clips and the wood chips you it is just it is like it is just together it is just a mixture well we have been learning about mixtures and solutions bye marni i had a lot of fun with you goodbye i will see you in your worst nightmares
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_014_comb the screen is catching the marbles but since the holes are smaller than the marbles the marbles just stay where they are and the water goes through because it is smaller than the holes the result of this happen because you know when you pour the mixtures together they are one mixture and then when you pour it through the screen all the sand gets caught together and the water just goes through the funnel
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_021_comb well what they do marni is that so when you put the salt in the water and you stir it they will just totally dissolve and i actually i am not really sure marni could you tell me why what happens marni is that the salt almost totally disintegrates in the water and there is just it just dissolves in the water and it is just clear so yeah deal with it marni can you repeat that marni
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_026_comb we can not because it is already in the water and that does not dissolve or sink to the bottom and it can not go through a filter either it is important because there there is a screen on top of the bowl and when you pour the marbles and the water on it it separates the two mixtures
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_016_comb how the mixtures change marni is because the the screen caught the sand and then cause the holes were smaller than the sand so the sand just stayed right there but the water is smaller than the holes so it just went right through okay
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_009_comb well the raisins nuts and m ms are being separated from each other and not a mixture anymore the peanuts raisins and candy are all getting separated into their own piles how i am really excited to learn with you martie
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_023_comb the mixture the salt will be getting dissolved instead of the water being dissolved into the salt and it is very important because it is just works i do not know marni i just really need help with it the trail mix has three different piles the peanuts the raisins and the m ms so they are not a mixture yet
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_020_comb well what happens is that basically it just dissolves into another one like sugar and tea and just basically yeah they just dissolve they are just they just do i am actually not really sure why why they just dissolve solutions just can not get separated especially because this one is powder and when you stir it it will just it will just go away it just dissolves into the water
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-35-26_MX_1.1_013_comb they are getting separated the important property is pebbles are getting stuck in the fan kay marni cause not all ones are going to work on to this well marni you can separate them with a fan so that they will get separated well it is a mixture of sand rocks tooth picks and paper clips
myst_014014_2014-01-13_13-43-29_MX_1.3_020_comb i noticed that the magnet still worked onto the paper clips so that it would the paper clips use a sieve so that it will catch the big pebbles you use something different because that is the only way you are going to get the paper clips out of the jar unless you hand pick them and that would take a while saw what happened was that the little pebbles got stuck in the filter
myst_014014_2014-01-13_13-43-29_MX_1.3_025_comb so that it will make the water clear well we are just doing a project on salt and seeing which one was going to be most the most dense so that the bigger rocks can be separated from the water and the pebbles the smaller pebbles well we talked about the mixture between the magnet and the paper clips and also we did the screen with the pebbles with the rocks
myst_014014_2014-01-13_13-43-29_MX_1.3_010_comb the proper property is that the rocks are too big to fit through the screen but the smaller pebbles and water are small enough to fit through the screen
myst_014014_2014-01-13_13-43-29_MX_1.3_004_comb well marni there is a mixture of it looks like sand rocks and paper clips and the the child is trying to magnetize the paper clips onto the magnet cause it is made of metal i realized that the pebbles got stuck in the screen
myst_014014_2014-01-13_13-43-29_MX_1.3_006_comb well marni the sand is smaller than the rocks so the rocks do not go through but the water does i am doing great marni how are you doing the magnet is magnetized to the paper clips it is trying to show you that the pebbles are not big enough to fit through the fan
myst_014014_2014-01-13_13-43-29_MX_1.3_012_comb the appropriate the important property here is the magnet is attracting the paper clips and taking them out of the mixture of paper clips sand tooth picks and rock it is a mixture marni
myst_014014_2014-01-13_13-43-29_MX_1.3_026_comb the salt is the best one because when you poured it into the dish and it evaporated over time you are going to see it very clearly by the next day because it is bigger than the holes the salt dissolved and it is important because the salt is a mixture
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-50-13_MX_1.2_003_comb well the the first one with the the water and the sand that makes the water all like muddy is because the the sand is probably more dense than the salt so it just makes it muddier and then the on the second picture the salt dissolves into the water and yeah we have been learning about mixtures and solutions
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-50-13_MX_1.2_005_comb well the salt is getting mixed into the water and it dissolves into it so it just looks like normal water a solution is like something getting mixed into water to make something and then a mixture is like paper clips and wood chips it plays a solvent zero yeah zero yeah zero yeah zero yeah i think it is a solvent
myst_014014_2013-12-18_12-50-13_MX_1.2_006_comb the sand and water mixture gets all like cloudy and also it just sinks to the bottom it does not dissolve like the salt does but the salt totally dissolves into the water sorry marney i have to go okay i will see you later bye good how are you one will be a darker purple well you need two different resources sweeter and heavier

myst_012032_2013-11-13_08-59-05_MX_1.2_041_comb if there is no water when the when the water turns into the water vapor it is not in the container anymore so the only thing left in the container is the salt the salt dissolves into the water but even though you can not see it it is still there so it does not lose any weight what did you say i think the point that this picture is trying to make is if you add a liquid to a solute you would get a solution
myst_012032_2013-11-13_08-59-05_MX_1.2_024_comb you could use a filter to get the solute out what did you say i think it means that it is a the water is playing the part of dissolving the grape i notice that if you add the weight of the water and the weight of the salt you would get the weight of the solution in the end
myst_012032_2013-11-13_08-59-05_MX_1.2_015_comb i notice that if you add the weight of the water and the other thing you get the amount of you get the weight of the other of the i think that this is a i notice that if you add up the gram i notice that if you add up the weight of the three that make up the mixture you get the weight of the mixture
myst_012032_2013-11-13_08-59-05_MX_1.2_034_comb i notice that the citric acid did not get caught in the filter it tells you that the mass of the stuff that you mix does not change the solvent is the water and it lets and we see that it does not lose any weight it just add evaporate the water
myst_012032_2013-11-13_08-59-05_MX_1.2_016_comb you see that the salt even though it disappears it does not lose any weight so that makes it so that if you add the weight of the solvent and the solute you will get the weight of the mixture i notice that the salt caught in the coffee i do not know
myst_012032_2013-11-13_08-59-05_MX_1.2_020_comb first to the person weighed the amount of water the water is turning into water vapor what did you say i can tell that solution one is the most concentrated and solution two is the least we could weigh them the solutions has different masses because one of them has twice as much solute as the i notice that the one on the right is more concentrated than the one on the left
myst_012032_2013-12-04_08-28-18_MX_2.2_009_comb i have learned that the one on the right was heavier that means that my prediction was right i think that the mass and the amount of the dissolved solute are related because the amount of solute well the more solute the more mass the solution has i do not know i can tell that solution one is the most concentrated
myst_012032_2013-12-04_08-28-18_MX_2.2_016_comb that i think that solution one is the most concentrated and solution two is the least concentrate i can tell you that the grape solution on the right side is the most concentrated and the grape solution on the left side is the least concentrated i think that the one on the right will weigh more the rock is a lot heavier than the feather you know like that
myst_012032_2014-03-10_12-41-19_SRL_2.1_031_comb a valley maybe a bit or something like that both is like there is a valley valleys are created by stuff stuff stuff valleys are created by stuff that i do not know there is a hole in it all that stuff and it does stuff to make a valley valleys are created by all that stuff
myst_012032_2014-03-10_12-41-19_SRL_2.1_048_comb it was neither erosion or deposition that created this delta it was your there is like stream tables and stuff you know
myst_012032_2014-03-10_12-41-19_SRL_2.1_002_comb yeah we have been talking about soil rocks and land forms how i am doing today that is my business mind your own
myst_012032_2014-03-10_12-41-19_SRL_2.1_008_comb erosion is eroding and making deposition and then once there is deposition that means that it eroded into the deposition to place stuff that does other stuff and then other stuff happens and then when that other stuff happens good but i have do the one on the slope got out more farther than the one on the no slope
myst_012032_2014-03-10_12-24-48_SRL_2.2_036_comb fast the volcano is erupting fast it is coming mega fast and i do not even know it is coming the water will flow faster did you just say something i notice that there is like the where it is steep the water is going more faster the erosion and deposition in the flood water source is going more
myst_012032_2014-03-10_12-24-48_SRL_2.2_037_comb fast but marney see i do not like you but will marry me this has to do with the flood things that we did and stuff it is a land slide we are all going to die one with flood with condition the erosion go more farther i am good i am very good today except that we have to do and that is not good
myst_012032_2014-03-10_12-24-48_SRL_2.2_018_comb the flow of water in the flood creek is moving a lot faster we have been learning about erosion and deposition erosion and deposition and stuff like that maneuvers the sand and the different and clay and the different specimens water goes more faster if there is more slopes than if there is no slope the water will start flowing faster
myst_012032_2014-03-10_12-24-48_SRL_2.2_009_comb the water with the slope well like the two hundred and forty-second zero i think that might have been it is happening very fast it is happening very fast flood water is moving faster on flat slope the water is flowing slowly and on the steep slope the water is flowing quickly they all look different
myst_012032_2014-02-10_10-03-28_SRL_1.1_002_comb we have been learning about soil land they are from different places i do not know they are getting mixed together the sodium hydroxide is all one molecule the water has two types of molecules you mix the thing i do not know
myst_012032_2013-12-20_09-11-12_MX_4.1_044_comb the rust on the bike the fizzing and bubbling they look different it is getting rained on and snowed on and it is getting rusty i do not know the bike got rusty so that is a chemical reaction no they can not there are baking
myst_012032_2013-12-20_09-11-12_MX_4.1_020_comb it means it means that it means that that there are bubble you are mixing two reactants to get a product there is baking soda citric acid and calcium chloride that the things are ice cubes did not do science today the glow stick started glowing
myst_012032_2013-12-20_09-11-12_MX_4.1_018_comb i notice that the molecules are i saw the product of fizzing and then it settled down fifty milliliters of salt solution is more concentrated than the fifty milliliters of water therefore it weighed those have to do with what we did with saturating the water
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-03-17_MX_3.1_009_comb that means that the solution is saturated saturated means that we can not dissolve any more of the epsom salt into the h twenty
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-03-17_MX_3.1_002_comb we have been talking about solutions with multiple solutes we have been talking about solutions with multiple solutes the solutions have to weigh the same means that the solution is saturated
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-03-17_MX_3.1_006_comb i noticed that when it is when the solution is saturated the water level has come above where it originally was i figured it out by taking the sixty-seven grams and subtracting fifty grams from and getting seventeen grams
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-03-17_MX_3.1_012_comb some of the epsom salts are on the bottom of the container we are try we are trying to saturate the water with sugar this means that the salt in the solution weighs seventeen grams
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-03-17_MX_3.1_004_comb the these have to do with what we did about saturating the water i do not know because of the bags is open which let out all of the gases a solid a liquid and a gas you made a three i do not know
myst_012032_2014-01-13_08-58-25_MX_4.2_017_comb a product a liquid and a gas we could observe it i do not know their molecules look there are three layers in the bag the first one that you made fizzed a lot and then the second one did not fizz
myst_012032_2014-01-13_08-58-25_MX_4.2_013_comb the concentration of the solution that both that the the one with the open bag weighs less i do not know
myst_012032_2014-01-13_08-58-25_MX_4.2_021_comb it tells us that the we have been talking about we have been talking about mixtures and solutions in the first mixture that is shown the solution fizzes and has a precipitate calcium chloride and baking soda
myst_012032_2014-02-19_10-06-21_SRL_1.2_005_comb weathering or i think it was as they go down the pieces get smaller will you marry me they were like rolled down a river and then they like broke up into smaller pieces because it can crack soils and rocks and land forms and stuff like that
myst_012032_2014-02-19_10-06-21_SRL_1.2_012_comb i said will you marry me and she said yes can break rocks apart good thinking the freezing jar breaks and the warm jar does not breaks that means that the freezing jar broke and the warm jar did not break which means that the freezing and abrasion the one on the the rocks broke apart
myst_012032_2014-02-19_10-06-21_SRL_1.2_026_comb that the pebbles and sand near the near the bottom of the river are much smaller than the pebbles and sand and clay at the when the water freezes it expands the delta
myst_012032_2014-02-19_10-06-21_SRL_1.2_013_comb the tree root is growing down and looking for water and the rock is in it is way so the tree root breaks there is water in the cracks and the water the limestone is dissolving because of the acid banana weathering it has happened to the banana statue with banana eyebrows that looks like your banana eyebrows and your banana well i did not know
myst_012032_2014-02-19_10-22-46_SRL_1.3_013_comb i have no idea i do not really see any banana and now your eye brows look like banana and now the banana rock is you showed me this last time and i explained it already so i am not going to explain it again because of chemical weathering
myst_012032_2014-02-19_10-22-46_SRL_1.3_005_comb the basalt is immune to the vinegar but the limestone can be feeling extremely terrible today so you do not really need to chemical weathering and stuff like that i guess there is green banana weathering the water is weathering away the limestone to make the cave into a limes
myst_012032_2014-02-19_10-22-46_SRL_1.3_014_comb is forming the limestone into it it did not rule out any options because they cleave instead of fracture because they do not fit the description that is a streak test we have quartz cause because they both scratch
myst_012032_2014-03-13_12-49-45_SRL_3.4_040_comb cause of some stuff you know it is not as hard as a diamond you know i do not really care i am just like watching a cool thing it is the igneous rocks you know it is sick this mineral exhibited a cleave
myst_012032_2014-03-13_12-49-45_SRL_3.4_044_comb because the rock we had fractured but those one did not i think that it is gypsum they narrowed our options down to quartz metamorphic rocks i am just playing with the igneous rocks so shut up it tells us that this mineral can be graphite or gypsum yeah yeah i guess i notice lava
myst_012032_2014-03-13_12-49-45_SRL_3.4_022_comb that is testing the hardness or no that is testing the break the scratch test that it did not scratch
myst_012032_2014-03-13_12-49-45_SRL_3.4_010_comb you would need the luster the break the streak the hardness the less concentrated one will go on the top and the more concentrated one will go on the bottom it are mixed together because solution b is trying to sink to the bottom
myst_012032_2013-12-09_09-47-04_MX_2.4_017_comb we added the lighter eleventh and then the more the denser one tried to sink to the bottom so they got mixed that is so cool more concentrated solutions are more dense than less concentrated solutions the lighter if we add the lighter salt solution last then it will then it will just stay on top
myst_012032_2013-12-09_09-47-04_MX_2.4_005_comb if it is less dense it will float more i do not know if it is more concentrated it is denser the penny is more concentrated than the cork cause one of them has more solute than the other one concentrated solutions float on the top the penny weighs more
myst_012032_2013-12-09_09-47-04_MX_2.4_010_comb solution b is more concentrated just means that solution b is more concentrated than than solution by looking at the solubility i think that it is epsom they saturated the water we can look at the crystal identification chart and evaporate the water and when we look at the solute in the container we can see that it is salt
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-13-34_MX_3.2_002_comb we have been talking about mixtures and solutions i noticed that it takes less citric acid to saturate fifty milliliters of water than it does to saturate the water with sugar they have to do with
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-13-34_MX_3.2_009_comb it means that some of the solute was i do not know i noticed that they are trying to saturate the water with epsom salt and with the mass pieces are showing us how much each solution weighs
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-13-34_MX_3.2_006_comb think it i think it is because the citric acid is more dense than the sugar
myst_012032_2013-12-17_13-13-34_MX_3.2_007_comb shows how much how much it it shows the weight of the solute needed to saturate the solvent that they are all different it has to do with what we did earlier today about those like stuff that like rocks and
myst_012032_2014-03-10_13-01-08_SRL_3.2_042_comb i do not know i was not really paying attention i was just playing with your computer program you know like the brightness and where the shadows are in that mineral they look a lot more different the brightness well this connects to what we have been talking about cause we made flashlights the diamond is a lot shiny more shiny than the like gypsum whatever it is
myst_012032_2014-03-10_13-01-08_SRL_3.2_033_comb on one too i do not know right now i am busy watching minerals are more like minerals than anti mineral maybe nothing and then i think diamond is right again the diamond draw a line on it it came from the mineral i just drew on your face with a sharpy i am sorry marney
myst_012032_2014-03-10_13-01-08_SRL_3.2_015_comb pay attention right now i am playing with frogs somebody cracked a a rock with a pick ax the tiles got z tile got a z on it because it did not work not letting me press the green arrow hardness i just said that so why are you asking me again but yeah i just said hardness
myst_012032_2014-04-17_13-02-48_SRL_3.4_011_comb they did not work that some of the things do not work a mineral properties table it relates to some mineral stuff like tons and tons tons can you can you feel my saliva through the thing
myst_012032_2014-04-17_13-02-48_SRL_3.4_006_comb this is useful for identifying minerals i guess you say what how easily it will get killed to death or no that is that is testing the break mineral identification chart
myst_012032_2014-04-17_13-02-48_SRL_3.4_016_comb you could testing hardness and streak or no you could not be testing streak you could be testing hardness or other properties that they they were too soft means to be you know
myst_997285_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_009_comb one is a scale one and the two cups chips and magnets and this other thing that we did not use in science they are being detached from each other fr by the washers how many wash metal washers it takes to break the force right and ok yes it does tell us
myst_997285_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_055_comb the more the metal washers the more likely it takes to break the magnetic force yes i can read the label it is seeing how many washers it takes to unhook two magnets it is telling me that the there is alot of weight on b on b on cup b and that it is yes we did and we did the graphs with stickers
myst_997285_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_007_comb when the magnets do not stick together anymore when you press the orange washer the one washer just separates the two magnets the two magnets sticking together and one washer is going into a cup see if it unhooks the two magnets that it is taking that many washers how many are in the cup to unhook the magnets chips it takes to see if when
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_086_comb the standard is some it is something that everyone agrees on yeah estimate is another word for guess and it is something it can not be like from the office to the room would be one meter that is not a very accurate
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_058_comb well if you think how if you walk down to the office before and like you for no reason counted your steps or something and you knew how many paces were in a meter or something then maybe you can make a more accurate guess by the steps that you have t taken to the office from the room
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_012_comb maybe we did not cut accurately or when we were doing the turns that might have been wrong what we did was we took the measuring tape and we put our finger at the end of it and then put our the tape right next to it again so yeah and it was a little confusing and i do not think it was one hundred and thirty-eight paces
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_008_comb well what we did was like we like i said we took the tape measure thing and we measured the the one pace that a girl took and then we we took a p a long sheet of paper i forgot what it is called no it was not that
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_072_comb cause what we did was we estimate a lot of stuff and if we make an accurate estimate then and it is not right then you should still try over again and see if it was right cause when we were measuring our paces mine was really small and i did not think it was it would be that small so i i measured it twice i measured it over again
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_018_comb like our meter tape or if it is something small we could use a ruler like those measuring tools you know so eh they are not that accurate i and we tried the straws once we measured our desk with straws and i do not think that was very accurate either yeah
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_030_comb maybe if we said if from the the very start of our room to the the door to the office then that would be i think yeah how we were yeah
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_002_comb well we have been measuring our paces and yesterday we kind of like there was someone is pace and we and we put it on the a tape p piece of paper thing and then we yes we as we practiced doing estimates they got a lot better yeah
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_082_comb like i said earlier we should always measure twice cause it might not be right cause the first time it was like this big and then the second time it was like this big so it was a lot easier to do that so it something that you have you should always try over again instead of just thinking and measure it twice yeah but we did not color em yet no
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_076_comb no i do not we did not measure it with a meter tape we measured it with i do not know what it is called but it is it is some kind of tape and wow it was like
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_078_comb i do not remember what it was called it was this skinny kind of piece of paper and it was in like a little tube thing shape and that is what it was i do not remember what it was called at all so estimating is another word for guess
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_084_comb yeah repeating things is better than just doing things once and i have heard that on shows always measure twice yeah well it it actually knows how many inches it is and it tells you how many inches it is or feet if we are using feet so or meters so it is a lot
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_004_comb what was we took another one of those and we measured the same thing and we did the same thing with that and we cut it the same length as that and then we went all the way down to the office with that and we tried to see how many paces it was and our group came up with one hundred and thirty ni eight but we do not think that was very correct
myst_996219_2008-20-11_00-00-00_MS_1.3_040_comb yeah but like i said we should describe it more from the beginning to the end of the office so yeah well the meter tape is one meter and my estimate would probably be from our classroom to the office would probably be i have no idea
myst_996219_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_050_comb no i do not remember us using the centimeters to measure anything yet but yeah no not yet we did not color em in yet no just so they would stay together but they had to be glued in a certain order which was kind of weird i do not know why they had to be glued and like they went from one to a one hundred so they were like a one hundred centimeters on there or something so yeah
myst_996219_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_034_comb we only made one per student so yeah everyone else had one we basically all got the same results some of the desks are higher but that did not really matter
myst_996219_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_052_comb well centimeters are used around the world and we are like the only place that uses inches and i think it is important that we learn how to use centimeters too so if we go somewhere else then we know how to measure things just yeah zero not yet no i do not remember that anything it was kind of complicated i did not get it really i did not get it all
myst_996219_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_016_comb it was like thirty-five straws but we only had one straw to measure with so we like used our finger to hold our spot and then put the straw right by our finger again so yeah they are pretty useful but they can not be useful for every single thing cause no i do not believe so i do not remember anything else
myst_996219_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_030_comb well we glued them together and we cut them out but we did not color them yet or anything like that i think they were for measuring centimeters not inches yeah i think so
myst_996219_2008-13-11_00-00-00_MS_1.1_060_comb i do not really remember anything else besides that miss hill was talking about some things about the centimeters but i do not really remember what she was saying cause that was like maybe it was miss wagner when we were right after we cut em out i do not know but i think yeah yep yes we measured our desks with straws
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_083_comb i think the metal would go down and the plastic would go up
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_027_comb no the paper clips were different sizes so if they were really small then they there were if a they were really small then if they were really small then it takes more to measure the actual chip plastic chip thing and if they are really big then it takes less that would be five paper clips
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_093_comb well if they are the same size then it it will weigh the s it will weigh the same thing and then i if it is not the same size then they weigh difference it will be a difference there
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_009_comb well we did not hold them first miss wagner put them in the cup i think i forgot well we were measuring with paper clips and we put the plastic chip in first and we did not get to the washer and the block of cardboard and then we put paper clips in until it was exactly level
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_041_comb i think you are thinking of the gram yeah well we did not we did not use those cause it was we were out of time so a gram is smaller than paper clips and some of them are all the same size and some of them are bigger than each other so those might not be efficient either one gram equals one gram
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_099_comb i think all of us would weigh it with different paper clips and we would see which one would be like the most efficient no did not get to that yeah probably a gram cause most of them are the same size no it is not telling you how much it weighs but it is telling you which thing is heavier
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_115_comb i e was most surprised that i thi i figured out that they were not all the same size so that is why we did not come up with the same answers cause then she taught us that some things are not the same size so we had we have to be very careful with our when we are measuring yeah but we put those in the the scale yeah the scale yeah
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_073_comb well metal is usually more heav heavier than plastic so cause plastic is not made of that much material and metal is made of more steelish things
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_101_comb well if it is a bigger paper clip it weighs more like metal and plastic metal weighs more and if it is small then it does not weigh as much so it is easy to tell which could weigh more
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_035_comb we could go and buy the same kind of paper clip that are the same what do you call it the same size the same size and then maybe you can remeasure and maybe it will both be four or both be two those might be big those are e little
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_047_comb i think that would be efficient if we all got the same piece but if we did not then like le like i said with the paper clips it would not be efficient yeah you would not be able to trust either of them they could just go completely blank and you would not know the actual result the answer we should all use the same size paper clips
myst_996219_2008-08-12_00-00-00_MS_2.1_033_comb well then you can show each other what your paper cli clip looked like and then you could say zero well yours is bigger than mine that explains how why yours was two and mine was four then we count how many we put in and it says four and that is how many paper clips weighs the plastic chip
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_006_comb i think it is all about numbering the the graph numbering the what your answer is and i think this helps better the graph the numbers help better than than than the little boxes you can use the graph when you are making a test you can do it by yourself you can draw the numbers and that would help you better
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_014_comb i think what that what that was all about is you are estimating how much the pendulum will will swing and i think this graph is all about you can measure the things you can see how you will make the pendulum it is going very well
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_003_comb the graph is about you have to measure you have to put how many for example you have to put there are a one hundred and ninety times and you have to do like you can put twenty all the way to to eighty and i think that is what the graph is all about
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_013_comb when you make an estimate i think you may get it right but maybe you will not because you do not know and you have not tested it so that is what i think and when we were trying to do pendulum some people just guessed and they did not even get by to that the first line is a
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_010_comb i think it effects it by making it longer or shorter because if you make it shorter i think it will go faster but if you make it longer i think it will go shorter i am good thank you for asking thank you for telling me
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_008_comb from what i can see i think the variable that is being tested is how many swings it makes in fifteen seconds and how fast it is going
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_006_comb well to really like control like a the string on each part well you could make it like shorter or longer or like use a different material that is like i think what you are trying to tell me but i am not quite sure but i think so that is what we changed one thing at a time to see if it did anything different
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_004_comb it is important to change one thing at a time because if you do not and there happens to be a big change you do not know which thing made that thing happened so you just need to change one thing at a time to see if it makes a difference
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_007_comb what makes it a controlled experiment each pendulum is made out of the same thing and we are basically from what i can see only changing the length of the string i have been seeing if we change each thing one at a time to see if a pendulum will swing faster
myst_996427_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_009_comb that is what i think i noticed that there are little dots to where the pendulum is length may be marked and how long it is or how many swings it took
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_012_comb well since nineteen centimeters is ninety sorry ninety centimeters for the number of swings for a pendulum i think it would make a bit little may be like may be six or seven it is because the length of the string is very long and i think it would be just kind of interesting i guess
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_009_comb the numbers are there to tell you how many swings there are and depending on the length you know how many swings are so you would mark where the swing is and if it is not exact it is okay well they mark the graph and just measure it i guess and
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_011_comb well it is marked at the twenty and it is a little farther out because it is probably on the twenty here and the length of the string might have been twenty centimeters and so may be that is how many swings the pendulum took and that is how long the pendulum was
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_008_comb the numbers are there and the name where it is like the length of the pendulum it is about graphing how many swings the pendulum makes and the length of the pendulum and where it marks up to it that is what i think it is all about
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_006_comb the numbering system i think would just be there so you would know where where it actually marked up to and it would help you so you just know where to go or like how to do it or like where the pendulum data would go it is going really well
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_002_comb i have kept seeing how many times the pendulum can swing in fifteen seconds and so far it keeps being at least twelve or ten
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_014_comb i think predicting on a graph is all about like thinking on what might happen or what changes it might make depending like on the length of the pendulum or how many swings or what would you like to change
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_005_comb i think the x axis is about the length of the pendulum and where it would mark to on the y axis and that is what i think it is about
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_017_comb okay oops so what if one hundred and twenty is seven thousand, one hundred and forty is a bit bigger so i think it would make may be five or four bec because it is just so long and there is so much weight and so i think it will not go fast enough and it would only get like five or four swings
myst_996427_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_016_comb on one hundred and twenty and length of string and on the number of swings it had seven swings and it looks like that it is because the string is pretty long do you mean the the bottom dot or the highest dot it is going very well thanks
myst_996427_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_005_comb we did not exactly make a graph yet we basically just made a t chart to see like how big the boats are how many passengers do you think would be able to fit in there like what other what other
myst_996427_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_006_comb my chart was not like that well it was kind of like that but except the box on top we used just mostly that and we did not and we did not really use a graph
myst_996427_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_004_comb i do not know about it i do not think i know what you are talking about the only word i really know in there is variable and it means change one thing it is going well because the same side opposites attracts the same ones repel
myst_004033_2014-01-24_09-45-38_EE_3.2_007_comb the north and the south if they re together then they attract for if there north and north or south and south together they work to actually go together they ll push each other away two magnets are stuck together and rest of the magnets well are repelling on top on and they re floating because they won t go on to the other magnet it attracts to the earth s north pole flowing the magnetic of the north to the south
myst_004033_2014-01-24_09-45-38_EE_3.2_004_comb they would stop attracting they would repel that the north and the south side they both can t see that facing the same way like the south is facing right left right now and the north is facing right and both of the magnets that are attracted to each other the magnets are repelling even when you push it s because it s work through the magnet because it just won t go together
myst_004033_2014-01-24_09-45-38_EE_3.2_012_comb she is using compass to see which way she is going and right now she is going north the magnet is attracting the big steel screw and it s also giving the magnetism that attracts the paperclip they re attracting each other through the table
myst_004033_2014-01-28_08-38-48_EE_3.3_012_comb the nail is made of iron and doing the magnet attracts the iron nail the iron nail actually it is also nail a magnet and it will attracts like paperclips and other metal object other steel or metal object or iron objects
myst_004033_2014-01-28_08-38-48_EE_3.3_005_comb magnetism is a certain range of how just how far like the it is like what makes the paperclip stick and how that works is that this magnetic field on the magnet and iron is attracted to magnetism only to a certain range so if it s beyond the range then they won t stick it s picking up the paperclip with its magnetism
myst_004033_2014-01-28_08-38-48_EE_3.3_011_comb so it s because the magnetism goes through the screw and then it attracts the paperclip the magnetic force is strong enough to go through objects the nail is much longer and its and the magnet is permanent magnet the nail is a temporary magnet
myst_004033_2014-01-28_08-38-48_EE_3.3_016_comb the magnetism is going through the nail and where it comes off the nail stops being a magnet you are when you take the magnet off its stops spinning right there and the paperclip also becomes a magnet from the nail they are have to have touched each other ones it s a temporary magnet it travels through iron slash steel objects
myst_004033_2014-01-28_08-38-48_EE_3.3_025_comb as you take the magnet off of the steel nail it goes away but when you put it the magnet back on yeah yeah when you put it back on it becomes magnetized then it also makes whenever it picks up magnetize too because it s not magnetized the all time they use magnetism to attract to the iron and to other and the for the
myst_004033_2014-01-28_08-38-48_EE_3.3_019_comb a temporary magnet is when the when the magnet is actually connected to the nail when it s not connected to the nail then it s not going to stick to the paperclip this is an open circuit they give it out the electricity that a need the other bulb goes out these are all parallel circuits and then giving in a line and to if one goes out then the rest of them stay there
myst_004033_2014-01-08_09-02-17_EE_2.3_019_comb the flow of electricity is an even ah they normally use a christmas to decorate christmas trees and houses filament is broken on the one on the left and the one at the right it s fine
myst_004033_2014-01-08_09-02-17_EE_2.3_029_comb because the wire is coming from the path is it s coming from the bulb that s spreading out and if negative side goes through the one that s working and goes through the little extra wire that would be like the positive side to that bulb and if the positive side isn t working then the bulb don t work the other bulb burns out also
myst_004033_2014-01-08_09-02-17_EE_2.3_026_comb it s the the flow of electricity goes to the battery and to the back from the battery to the light bulb back to the battery for all three of them into the filament brakes and then the then the electricity stops flowing to the one that broke the whole strings burnout depending on what it s the switch is open
myst_004033_2014-01-08_09-02-17_EE_2.3_010_comb circuits and if a bulb does have to hold like as a the whole thing because we need to find out which bulb was the one that went out and the one that s burnt out that s not good the series circuit transfers energy from one bulb to the other bulb from the battery so if one is gone then the other light bulb can t get its energy so it goes out also it s both the circuit with lighting the bulbs with this is a parallel circuit
myst_004033_2014-01-08_09-02-17_EE_2.3_021_comb the other bulb stays on and that ones the any one that burns out unless any others burn out the bulb went out in the middle and then the rest of the series circuit is broken it s still works because the other bulb has its path i don t and its what it s working because when one bulb goes out the other stays on the electricity gets to the bulbs in the series circuit from one to the other but in a parallel it comes from the battery
myst_004033_2014-01-08_09-02-17_EE_2.3_024_comb the flow stops in the filament in the filament in the bulb with the filament broken because the electricity is flowing through the bulbs through the other bulb and when the filament breaks that can t transfer the energy to the other one so they get so the power is done seeing how strong the force of magnetism is what do you think
myst_004033_2014-02-03_10-10-53_EE_3.4_013_comb it is too weak so even one washer can just break the force makes it harder to get that the magnetism is weaker quick through the through the spacers it makes the magnetic pole weaker the magnet can t attract the magnet can t attract the paperclip to such thick stack
myst_004033_2014-02-03_10-10-53_EE_3.4_019_comb add more spacers you can add spacers magnets and it s how strong there easy for magnets to attract through it gets weaker and weaker and finally it breaks they adding another one makes it weaker because they re farther away additionally a certain amount of washers that can be put in before the magnetism breaks because it s too strong it have a weight on the other
myst_004033_2014-01-22_09-00-18_EE_3.1_004_comb they only attract iron or other things made of iron the fan in the refrigerator are both made of iron or steel and also they both they both are there are flattish are flat enough of the surface so it sticks it creates a magnetic force that pulls it to the magnet
myst_004033_2014-01-22_09-00-18_EE_3.1_020_comb if the black rock sticks the gray the brown gray rock didn t i thought you meant the black rock they re made of steel it s sticks because is made of only steel and iron stick to magnets while others do not
myst_004033_2014-01-22_09-00-18_EE_3.1_027_comb because metals and it have metals in a rock like iron stick steel and then the others that are sometimes if they re metal they don t actually stick to the magnets so not everything sticks we ve been working with magnets one is made of tin and then the other one is made of steel
myst_004033_2014-01-22_09-00-18_EE_3.1_011_comb the nail sticks to the magnet because it s made of iron and woodblock does not have any iron or steel in it so it doesn t stick there is iron and steel is made of iron just reinforced it s made of steel it has steel and the wood block has
myst_004033_2014-01-22_09-00-18_EE_3.1_015_comb even like only iron and steels so if these are like copper that won t stick and also if it s not even a conductor for actually electricity that it won t stick at all the iron it s made of iron and steel wood yarn copper and some other kinds of metals
myst_004033_2014-01-22_09-00-18_EE_3.1_018_comb only the steel and iron things are sticking to the magnet the steel well the iron and steel stick to their it makes stronger electric flow to the rivet
myst_004033_2014-02-11_08-40-41_EE_4.1_026_comb if you magnetizing the steel screw it will become magnetize so it can pick up other stuff with the steel screw same thing with rivet if the rivet is steel and you can also pick up the washers with it when it s when it s electrified and magnetized a temporary magnets are magnets that are always magnet you can make that you can make them just become normal like metal
myst_004033_2014-02-11_08-40-41_EE_4.1_028_comb if you turn it off then that it will not attract any washer if the electricity isn t flowing it does not magnetize the screws so it does not pick up any washers the electricity stops it starts sticking electric electrified and the magnetism disappears
myst_004033_2014-02-11_08-40-41_EE_4.1_011_comb the circuit is just the same with like powering a motor so it has to be flown from the and the negative the electricity is traveling around the it s like and it goes into the other wires the electricity is coming on the negative side going through it is and then the stuff into the and its goes backs to the battery it becomes a magnet a temporary magnet
myst_004033_2014-02-11_08-40-41_EE_4.1_006_comb when its electric it has electric current running through it get magnetized so when there is no electric current it becomes unmagnetized it let s the electric flow go to the metal through the wire and so more you wrap it around the stronger is the magnetism gets an electro magnet magnetizes the washers and the switch opens and closes turn it on and off
myst_004033_2014-02-11_08-40-41_EE_4.1_022_comb it magnitude up to the rivet if the switch isn t connected the electricity can flow and it can not become a magnet how many times you wrapped around the wire because that that difference that makes the flow of electricity go a little stronger or weaker electricity in magnetism only goes around iron and steel
myst_004033_2014-02-11_08-40-41_EE_4.1_024_comb when the switch is open it starts its magnetizing that the steel washers it is electrified by the when it is yeah electricity is flowing through it it makes the magent for those little washers a closed circuit a closed switch might be electrified may be a magnified we made an electromagnet
myst_004033_2014-02-11_08-40-41_EE_4.1_020_comb switch controls the flow of electricity okay electrified screw to make it magnetism and you ve asked me like this a one hundred times not where it would not turn the suns we have not done anything new but we have been working on circuits and and what the flow of energy
myst_004033_2013-11-19_09-46-11_EE_1.2_005_comb it the energy is going through it making the motor spin and then of course the extra energy goes into the positive side like we learned about yesterday it has to be fully the solar cell is gathering the suns energy and converting it into electricity to turn the motor the motor goes when it is closed but as soon as it opens up it stops
myst_004033_2013-11-19_09-46-11_EE_1.2_003_comb the battery is powering the motor so the little flag is spinning and then the the energy from the the extra energy is going back through into the battery electricity is traveling through it and back this is a switch it they can work the suns energy into electricity that you can
myst_004033_2013-11-19_09-46-11_EE_1.2_026_comb it is showing that the circuit is going from the negative end of the battery to the motor it is making the motor spin and then the extra energy is going back into the positive side the motor gets electricity there must be a full circuit from the battery to the motor and back to the battery or else the energy does not flow all the way if it it has to be faced the circuit has to close maybe if if if sun is showing through the clouds but if not no
myst_004033_2013-11-19_09-46-11_EE_1.2_023_comb the motor starts turning because the sun is the suns energy is going on to the solar panel so no energy is flowing the solar cell has to be in the sun it it has the energy go into the motor and then it turns the little metal part and then the little flag is attached to the end so it will turn the flag it stops turning the energy does not get all the way around it to the the paperclip is completing the circuit
myst_004033_2013-12-02_10-06-54_EE_1.3_020_comb they are mostly made of metal i don t think there are any others that are not metal but if they are metal then you know they are conductors the crap stick keeps it from keeps the electricity from flowing because it absorbs all of it if they were insulators they will not let the electricity flow there is an open circuit but it s being closed by a screw
myst_004033_2013-12-02_10-06-54_EE_1.3_004_comb one is a screw it must be something to replace the to make it the open circuit the craft stick isn t making a difference so it s still open electricity goes into the insulators but does not come out the other end i think it actually might be closed because it still got completing it insulators do not let the electricity flow through them these objects are all made of metal
myst_004033_2013-12-02_10-06-54_EE_1.3_019_comb the circuit with the insulator will have the electricity go to the insulator instead of through the wires to get to the motor so it can t reach the motor it is not made of metal and its made of plastic and plastic is an insulator or metal is a conductor trying to get a
myst_004033_2013-12-02_10-06-54_EE_1.3_013_comb it takes the energy from the wires and it doesn t let it get to the to the motor one of the wires is getting to the motor but the other one the motor it but the other one is going to the switch and the switch is open but the paperclip completes the switch in a has the wire going back to the motor thought it was the electricity so it can reach the light bulb
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_012_comb the only way you can get a light bulb to light up is if you have both electricity electricity sides like the and the positive connecting to it carry electricity from the the battery to the light bulb and from the lightbulb to the battery the little blue balls are traveling through the wire and getting to the light bulb and going back to the battery i think the blue balls or balls represent the electricity
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_022_comb the positive side receives it and the battery just keeps sending it out and it just keeps going until you one of the wires it is the receiver of the electricity that means it gets the electricity and it also sends it back where it is mostly just receiving it to lighten it up i think the electricity would not be able to flow because you have to have one on the casing and one on the base or else it does not make it out of the light bulb
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_025_comb is that the negative wire the negative wire let me try that again the positive side is touching that the the the bottom of it when you start it out but you can flip it around it does not really matter the light bulb lights up no matter which side you have on the casing you just have to have one on the casing one on the base that is it
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_017_comb electricity flows from the negative end through the wire through whatever you are connecting it to back to the positive end the batteries are the stored electricity that when you put the two wires on the ends and connect them to the light bulb that is what makes the light that is the thing that makes the light bulb light up
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_026_comb the electricity is flowing through the negative side no matter what gets through the light bulb and comes back to the positive side no matter what what place it is in except if it is on the outside of the bulb it the wires have to be touching that little knob at the end of the d cell on the positive side or else the electricity does not get back in
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_027_comb when it is have to be touching the casing or the base of the light bulb or else it can not flow because the outside of the light bulb like the glass does not conduct electricity the light bulbs are what you need electricity to turn on and off and when were and
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_006_comb the wires are the things that connects connect the energy source to the whatever you are powering like for this example light bulbs that it has to be that from the electricity comes from the negative side it goes into the light bulb with the wire touching the light bulb and then when it goes out the the positive side wire goes in the bottom and then the electricity flows back into the battery
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_005_comb that is where the electricity comes from to heat up the little part that lights the light what happens to the flow of the the electricity it still flows the same way but it actually it still flows from the negative side into the positive side but it just traveling it is traveling the other way through the other wires it means that the current of electricity never really stops it just keeps moving we have been learning about electromagnetism
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_003_comb a battery a light bulb two wires blue dots represent the electricity flowing without the wires there would be no connection of electricity and then it would not light up the light bulb
myst_004033_2013-11-18_09-26-49_EE_1.1_020_comb the negatives wire flows into the light bulb the light bulb flies into the flows into the positive wire the positive wire travel into the positive side towards the positive side it means that that is what can that is the pathway that the electricity flows through to get to the light bulb and back they are a lot brighter
myst_004033_2013-12-17_09-50-55_EE_2.2_003_comb a parallel circuit one is just getting it s electricity from the other one we ve been working with open circuits closed circuits and parallels circuit the energy is coming from the negative side and it splits into the two wires goes to the lightbulb and goes around back into the positive side twice about the
myst_004033_2013-12-17_09-50-55_EE_2.2_018_comb there is two pathways one is just coming from a light bulb and the other one is actually coming from the d cell i think a parallel very long parallel would help with the bulbs in lighting them up it is a parallel circuit but its a little more complicated because the both of the wires are going the same way with going to the different lightbulbs adding a better rivet it can split it up into two different circuits
myst_004033_2013-12-17_09-50-55_EE_2.2_005_comb for both of the lightbulbs they have to share one d cell out of the negative back into the positive they have to share a pathway and it s light weaker because the lightbulb s had already had used some of that for their own energy they get even brighter
myst_004033_2013-12-17_09-50-55_EE_2.2_019_comb in a parallel circuit each has it s own little pathway so it s both go coming from it from the battery to the other side of the battery and it s for both of them but they re still connected on the battery on the same one both of the lightbulbs get their own little circuit instead of sharing one big one it is a it s a complete circuit for both of them
myst_004033_2013-12-17_09-50-55_EE_2.2_016_comb comes from the come from the negative side goes through go goes into the positive or negative side wait no positive side they are much brighter the lightbulbs are just getting some energy from themselves that s already been used
myst_004033_2013-12-17_09-50-55_EE_2.2_017_comb flow is coming from the negative going into the bulb but also the other wires getting some of the negative too so it s start flowing goes to the lightbulb comes out of the lightbulb goes to the other lightbulb goes up and then back into the positive side
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_010_comb yes well we have been measuring our desk with straws and we figured out that not when we measure with straws that it is not a standard unit of measurement because not every straw is the same
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_076_comb because then it would not be the same like if you just used body parts usually your hands are if you have used your hands then usually they are different a lot of different sizes so it would be very weird lots of them get different answers well it is like it is something that never changes
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_060_comb we we got a pa we got a piece of paper and we had to find we we had to s find something we we had to measure a thing and then write our estimate and then write what it really was and then write the difference between
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_058_comb that measuring a person is i mean estimating how a person is big it is pretty hard because when you you are like sometimes you think that it is just ninety-six and it is really like a meter and twenty-five yeah it would not it would not cause if somebody wanted to measure something then they it would not be really the same i learned that
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_052_comb we estimated well it is making a good guess and like if you are measuring i mean if you are estimating like a box full of something and it is clear i think that you should like first count the ones on the edges just to and then make it more
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_026_comb because then people would not really have the same things like if you wanted a house to be as big like a mansion or something and then it was really small then it would be kind of disappointing we tried to find something that was a meter in the room and almost all of us said the meter stick
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_022_comb well because the king made a copy of his foot the same big and and then he gave it to the apprentice and then he made the bed because then people sometimes when they when they usually get their estimate by then they will not have to er that america is the only place that does not use the metric system
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_014_comb because then if you wanted to measure something like we read the book how big is a foot and it is about a king and he wants to make a bed for the queen and he calls the apprentice and he the apprentice is really small and has really small feet and he says that the bed should be six feet tall and three feet wide and so the bed was really tiny and then it would not be able to fit the queen
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_034_comb were they some of them were similar but some of them were really different because it is not a not all straws are the same height well like i said we tried to find something on our body that was one inch six inches and it is always the same it never changes
myst_996290_2008-10-12_00-00-00_MS_1.1_050_comb measured the bookshelf it never changes i think that one of them was
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_032_comb and the temperature probably changed because because some people probably took a little thermometer because themo thermometer cause of the ice cube that it was changing the temperature was usually it started at twelve and then ended at six so it was in between those
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_038_comb because they are reald really little teeny tiny lines and you can scarcely see where it is and it was like sometimes in between i do not know
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_014_comb yeah yeah but we took turns doing it so it took longer instead of just one person yeah and then because the thermometer it was not used to that temperature because it was just an error and then the thermometer got used to it so it so it sort of stayed the same
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_022_comb yeah and one time it was at like at seven then it was at six then it was at seven then it was at eight then it was at six yeah it was weird well we got these tubes sort of like and then we filled them up with water like we pulled this button and
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_044_comb it might be cause i was moving it well well i was i was putting the thermometer like on one side so we could see it better i noticed that the water when the ice cube melted it was colder than if the ice cube was still in there
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_074_comb yeah yeah and then our teacher she only messed up on the last two
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_012_comb yeah we were the last ones to finish yeah yeah and then and then we used this one hundred cup that had one hundred and then we put it inside but that was not so good either it did not fill up so much either because the syringe was just fifty it did it a little faster but not so fast so
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_016_comb it always has to be no air inside it so so you can get the water inside because maybe because maybe because we could not tell it so well that
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_072_comb zero i saw a couple of em we well we did this also and we every table had a name and it went all the way up to e and then we put our finger in every single one and tried to put them in order from the coldest to warmest and our table was the coldest
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_024_comb in the beginning no but in the end sort of yeah i have i have one time when i was swimming at a beach that happened to me like the water was real cold and then when one spot it was really warm
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_068_comb that was probably because the temperature the thermometer
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_004_comb yes well we were we got zero these i can not remember what they are called
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_056_comb well we were just staring at the clock and we we not not every time we started at the twelve because then it would take even more time cause we just waited til it got to one certain number like not in between
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_078_comb yeah and and we also yeah and we also messed up well well i did not i i messed up on one other thing i messed up on well i thought that the f and the a was turned around but it was not
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_092_comb it is yeah except it was just a smaller piece of paper it was a smaller it did not have all of the lines and it did not have the numbers either so it says that it started at ten and then at s eighteen minutes yeah yeah
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_060_comb yeah well we had this piece of paper and on one side it said minutes and then one and all the way up to ten and then it said temperature on the other side and then there were lots of boxes like ten boxes and we had to write the temperature for every minute inside just keep it in one spot
myst_996290_2009-21-01_00-00-00_MS_4.2_084_comb yes except we did not like do cold medium we just said it in the order it is not a standard unit of measurement like i said these were like the cubes the one and the five we tried to get a one hundred and we used the
myst_996290_2009-07-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_062_comb zero yeah we had this and each person we went around the table and each person took a thing and they put it inside the cup and then each person at the table met estimated and then we actually measured kind of we we tried to get with our with our grams we tried to get
myst_996290_2009-07-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_074_comb well we put gravel into a bag and then that ten thousand, one hundred bags of grams would equal one kilogram yes the the chip
myst_996290_2009-07-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_080_comb grams grams and we used the the blocks to make it we put a one hundred of the blocks inside and then we tried to make it equal instead cause instead of using all of those blocks we could just use
myst_996290_2009-07-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_034_comb that everybody uses the same thing yeah it was just those things because other people got tiny paper clips and some big paper clips and we got huge paper clips because when we put in the paper clip it would move a little and then when we put a lot in then it would be equal
myst_996290_2009-07-01_00-00-00_MS_2.3_068_comb we did not use the little cubes we just used paper clips instead yeah or or using the the box that would take forever well usually like mine were five away sometimes in class we used a scale to tell which was more concentrated because there was no
myst_014012_2014-01-15_12-45-02_MX_2.1_022_comb you can change the concentration of a solution by how much water is in the cup it is called a solvent to make a solution you add the grape fantastic to the water or the solute and mix em solid solute
myst_014012_2014-01-15_12-45-02_MX_2.1_020_comb the taste is thicker and more strong i guess zero you can change the concentration of the drink by it would taste sugar and thicker if it had a higher concentration
myst_014012_2014-01-15_12-45-02_MX_2.1_014_comb the darker solutions are more concentrated than the lighter solutions have a darker color and probably taste different that in the first cup there is more powder so it is more concentrated and a darker color in the second cup it is less concentrated and a lighter color i have no idea what you just said so
myst_014012_2014-01-15_12-45-02_MX_2.1_010_comb to determine concentration you can use weight to tell which is more concentrated the concentration would be more if there was less water and more powder we can change the concentration of the cool aid by how much water is in the cool aid called the other component a solute
myst_014012_2014-01-15_12-45-02_MX_2.1_003_comb in this animation one cup of water there are two cups of water one gets more concentrated cause it has two spoons of grape fantastic the second one is less concentrated because it only has one spoon of grape fantastic we have been studying concentration they are diluted and have less color
myst_014012_2014-01-15_12-45-02_MX_2.1_012_comb i can tell it is more or less concentrated by how much the color is the darker color is more concentrated is the lighter color is less concentrated the taste would be different in that the one with five spoonfuls and fifty milliliters of water would have more taste and taste thicker than the one with only one spoonful
myst_014012_2014-01-15_12-45-02_MX_2.1_016_comb because they are diluted and there is less powder in them the water in a solution is a solvent we can tell a solution has more or less solvent by what color it is or how concentrated it is it shows that mixtures and solutions are mixtures and solutions
myst_014012_2013-12-17_13-00-31_MX_1.2_015_comb that when you mix things they have both the weights combined the mixed end result has all of the peanuts raisins and m and ms the solid in this picture is the water that it is a mixture not wait no it is a solution sorry it is not a mixture it is a solution i think it is a property of a solution
myst_014012_2013-12-17_13-00-31_MX_1.2_002_comb we learned how to separate different material the animation showed that when you add more grams that it becomes heavier
myst_014012_2013-12-17_13-00-31_MX_1.2_005_comb the salt and water mixture equals no a dissolved salt mixture the sand and water mixture equals a mixture that is brown where the sand has not dissolved repeat that please you can filter out a solute in a solution that it is a mixture
myst_014012_2013-12-17_13-00-31_MX_1.2_024_comb the flour falls to the bottom of the water then it gets poured into the filter and only the water comes through the filter because the flour has bigger particles than the filter they become heavier and the salt dissolves by letting the solute evaporate
myst_014012_2013-12-17_13-00-31_MX_1.2_004_comb the salt and water mixture dissolves the sand and water mixture does not dissolve it is a mixture
myst_014012_2013-12-17_13-00-31_MX_1.2_029_comb considered a solution marney i have to go now the salt dissolved into the water it is a mixture
myst_014012_2013-12-17_13-00-31_MX_1.2_009_comb something like salt the water is playing the solution i noticed that fifty grams the water fifteen grams the salt equals sixty-five grams the salt and the water they are different because the salt dissolves into the water it is being added
myst_014012_2013-12-17_13-00-31_MX_1.2_014_comb the number underneath the final cup is both the fifty grams and the fifteen grams combined equaling sixty-five grams the salt dissolves into the water so all of it can go through the filter no there is not there is a chemical reaction because when the water is added onto the pan rust is formed
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_048_comb there is a solution when the mix the ingredients inside the glow stick are shifted and crack the scientific term is product i think there was a chemical reaction cause when the ice cubes are added they float to the because they are more dense than the water after a period of time the glass gets foggy and wet
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_003_comb vinegar and baking soda was added together and it it it created c two or some type of gas and bubbled up to the top no there is not a chemical reaction here i know this because this did not fizz there is some of each type of molecule in the solution
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_043_comb there is not a reaction because because there is not a second product
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_016_comb in this animation baking soda is added to vinegar and the vinegar and baking the vinegar is a solvent that the baking soda dissolves into created a chemical reaction where the solution fizzed up to the top creating c two
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_009_comb the one to the left is citric acid the one in the middle is baking soda and the one to the right is calcium chloride i do think there was a chemical reaction because there is a bubbly
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_040_comb when the solutions were added together the two products were added together the solution bubbled and fizzed up to the top but then it calmed down into clear blue water at the end the precipitate is at the bottom sitting and it is white and the water is at the top
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_012_comb calcium chloride and baking soda were mixed calcium chloride and citric acid were mixed and baking soda and citric acid were mixed in cup twelve and when you mouse over the things molecules
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_047_comb there is a chemical reaction because when the glow stick is bent it lights up and glows so the ingredients inside get mixed together to make a glowing substance a reaction is taking place because the water fizzed up and then calmed down
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_019_comb the vinegar has small yellow and blue balls the baking soda has white combined balls and when they are added together they get these blue and white balls a little bit of each bye marni i had a lot of fun making sandwiches riding on unicorns and playing mario some of the molecules are together and some are
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_050_comb well first i learned how to make a sandwich then i rode on a rainbow unicorn last but not least i played in the snow i am having a bad day marni no there is not because nothing dissolved into each other the water glass got foggy
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_028_comb in this animation sodium hydroxide is added to water as added to fifty milliliters of water so it hydraulic acid the water becomes a little more foggy and it becomes a solution
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_030_comb the water at first just has blue molecules then when the hydraulic acid is added there is purple odd looking molecules i think a type of gas was created the chemical reaction is here because when the carbonated water is being poured into the empty glass it fizzes i forget what we were doing in science
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_025_comb baking soda and calcium chloride they always can go back to the reactants because everything from earth can start over how it was first formed i think the bubbling in water is missing
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_023_comb there are two cups one has water in it and there is two spoons one has baking soda in it and one has calcium chloride well at first the products were blue when added together they became purple so therefore i think it is a chemical reaction the reactant molecules look like the product molecule it can be separated
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_039_comb there is a chemical reaction when added together they become fizzy and fill up to the top but after a couple of seconds it calms down into clear blue water baking soda and calcium chloride we called these reactant
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_036_comb two products are being added together at first they are clear and blue but when added turn the water is gaining molecules from the hydraulic acid
myst_014012_2014-02-11_12-29-11_MX_4.1_044_comb in this animation as the months passed first rain gets poured on the bike then snow gets left on the bike and when the snow finally melts there is rust left because it has we called them reactants yeah a circuit is a form elec of electricity
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_066_comb well you just put a wire and well first you need you need a place to well first you need to have a place to put the you need to have a battery holder and then you put the battery in there and then you get the other wires and then you attach the wires to to the battery
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_076_comb in the wrong in the wrong place because one side should be ne ey if the plus side i i mean the negative side is touching the other negative side then then it will not work because
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_014_comb ell a circuit is some is well if you want to light something or make something work then a circuit is the shape that the electricity travels in and it is like a circle shape
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_070_comb now in this picture there are two batteries that are being used to light two light bulbs we have been working with on electricity well the batteries will probably be in and the other side should probably be on the positive side
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_056_comb going the good way because the energy is still going out of the negative end so once you have a circuit and the wires are connected to the battery and the light bulb then the light bulb will light yes this probably would work
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_022_comb to have a circuit you have to get you have to have wires and they have to be connected to a battery and an electricity receiver which could be a light bulb well e the it is the way that the it is the way that the that the
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_072_comb you click on the battery and the light bulbs do not light that is because the battery is probably in in the wrong place in this picture there is another circuit and all the energy is still running out of the negative side of the battery and the lights are brighter because there are two batteries
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_110_comb this would work too probably es you can still make a circuit with two batteries well you can light a light bulb you can light more light bulbs if you make the circuit larger
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_040_comb some more you need more wires and possibly more light bulbs batteries and that is all we have been making circuits and the circuits make the l make the lights turn on
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_062_comb ell you just have to get more wires and attach the wires to the batteries and then you can still make a circuit but if you do it like this then the light bulb will probably be will be probably have will be probably be even more bright
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_082_comb they have to be in the right place for it to no but i think that it will work like that the battery is being used to light two light
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_024_comb well if you want to light something then you have to have wires that are connected to a battery and the wires also have to be connected to the light bulb in order for it to light that the electricity works no it does not show the energy energy going to the light but i meant to say that the
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_028_comb then the then the light bulb lights it would probably have no difference cause it because the ne cause the positive side always has to be always has to be receiving energy yes it will be even brighter than with one battery
myst_997283_2008-15-12_00-00-00_ME_3.1_006_comb electricity is what we use to have to have light with and heating and we use a lot of electricity it probably will work we did work with something like this yes without any electricity the rivet cannot be used as a magnet
myst_997283_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_014_comb well we were learning about electricity and before electricity we were learning arou about the magnetism about magnetism and today we learned about magnetism and electricity at the same time
myst_997283_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_003_comb so today in science we had to make we had to try to use a rivet to pick up to pick up some to pick up some little met because it uses electricity to to be a magnet and pick up things and i think that that is why you call it an electromagnet
myst_997283_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_009_comb well if you wrapped well the more times you wrapped the well more times you wrap the wire about around the rivet then it would then there would be some more power each time you wrapped it around
myst_997283_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_015_comb well we used electricity to power the we used the electricity to power the steel rivet and we and we also used magnetism to make the steel rivet pick up all the washers good how are you
myst_997283_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_007_comb yes there was the more times you wrap the wire around the rivet the more power it would have against yes that is right and they both workwith each other
myst_997283_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_023_comb well the switch turned on and when the switch is turned on the electricity can flow and and the when the electricity was on then the when the electricity switch was on then the steel rivet could could work and pick up some of the me metal washers
myst_997283_2009-15-01_00-00-00_ME_4.1_026_comb yes science is very cool yes that is correct to on two magnets if you have a north pole and a south pole then this means that the two magnets will attract to each zero yes the magnets both must have a strong force of attraction so the ne so the magnet is sticking to a nail and the nail is sticking to a paper clip
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_057_comb well it can stick to most steel and iron objects but some objects it cannot stick to so part time it is yes it is because i believe that a paper clip is made of iron or steel and a saint i mean a magnet only sticks to a magnet only sticks to anything that is made of iron or steel
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_043_comb the nail the magnet and the and the paper clip are showing force of attraction yes it is because it is made of iron or steel i forgot the name wa of what is happening the magnets on the right side of this picture are s will stick to each other or attract to each other because the north and south poles are facing each other
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_025_comb yes that is correct no not exactly but we did projects similar to this well the well other things in the picture are a sponge a washer a paper holder a paper clip two rocks a craft stick two nails a bit of a plastic straw a sponge and that is all
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_023_comb well the steel wire screen is sticking to the magnet and that is what is happening well the ma i think that the magnet will stick to the steel wire screen the the dark colored nail the paper clip the washer and that is all
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_063_comb the magnet is moving because these two magnets must have a very strong force of attraction and it has to be some high force of attraction for the two magnet yes they are well in this scene there are a lot of there are a lot of objects and the magnet will only stick to a few of the object to a few of the objects
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_037_comb no because a sponge is not made of steel or iron well as you can see the the force of attraction the force of attraction is is very strong in this picture because the force of n of these two magnets is going through the thin the thin piece of paper or the thin object
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_1.3_011_comb well the two north and south poles are facing each other so that means as i told you the north and south poles stick to each other or attract so it will attract and a magnet well a magnet is made of anything is made of iron or steel then it sticks to any steel m to any steel or iron made object we have been working on magnetism
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_2.1_009_comb no we have not worked on light bulbs yet the attraction force is where the the two n north and south poles attract to each oth
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_2.1_007_comb there are two things on a magnet called north and south poles and when there are two north and south poles then they connect to each other but when there are two north poles or two south poles they repulse e from each other
myst_997283_2008-20-11_00-00-00_ME_2.1_003_comb we are learning about the force of attraction and force of repulsion and the force of attraction is when twenty-two magnets stick together and the force of repulsion is when two magnets repulse from each zero earth and the universe the interacting parts in in it i do not know what you are asking it shows the muscles we have been learning about systems
myst_022201_2014-11-14_11-45-34_LS_1.1_032_comb it is telling me what they are and what they if they are a consumer or if they are a a decomposer is a system and we are learning about systems it helps by making something happen with involving the system i think it is made of plants and animals it is an earth it is the earth and that is a system that the human body is a system they make other things happen
myst_022201_2014-11-14_11-45-34_LS_1.1_030_comb webs means that it shows what animals are eating and how and what they eat and what they what eats them it is showing food webs and i clicked on the on the tundra the icy areas and it is showing what people what animals and what animals eat in a food web
myst_022201_2014-11-14_11-45-34_LS_1.1_024_comb i see that it when i hovered over the top of africa it brought up desert so i think it is because there are many interacting parts involving animals people and other things can you repeat the question can you repeat that question there are ecosystems and i forget the rest
myst_022201_2014-11-14_11-45-34_LS_1.1_008_comb it has many things inside of it i notice that they all lead up to bacteria and mushrooms things that do not eat but the eat but they do they do eat but they i said that wrong they they are being eaten so that they only eat one specific thing other parts of the body highlight
myst_022201_2014-11-14_11-45-34_LS_1.1_028_comb they can i do not know i think they represent jungles deserts bodies of water and ice what things eat and what eat them plants and animals those are the wheels and they make the car move
myst_022201_2014-11-14_11-45-34_LS_1.1_009_comb i see wheels a i see wheels and they make the car move i see a seat and that is where people can sit on and i see a wheel and that controls where you drive how you drive and which way you go it help it says that it it is that there are many things in a system they get their energy from dead plants and animals
myst_022201_2014-12-10_10-43-55_LS_1.3_001_comb how are you we have been learning about systems they make their energy by eating other living things bacteria is a decomposer being an herbivore means that you only eat plants it is telling me what it makes them producers because they do not have to eat other living things to survive
myst_022201_2014-12-10_10-43-55_LS_1.3_003_comb they are all part of the of a big system i think that a moose is a herbivore they are producers because they do not have to eat other things because they make their own food by photosynthesis they make compost so that gardens and other plants can grow
myst_022201_2014-12-10_10-43-55_LS_1.3_022_comb i think that a bear is an omnivore because they eat both plants and animals to be a decomposer means that you make other you make things for other living for other living things like compost
myst_022201_2014-12-10_10-43-55_LS_1.3_012_comb a decomposer eats dead plants and animals the bug the bird the hawk the snake the bunny and the salamander some of those consumers only eat meat some of them only eat plants some of them eat both and some of them eat decaying matter i think
myst_022201_2014-12-10_10-43-55_LS_1.3_023_comb it connects to being a carnivore because they only eat meat that they are neither a herbivore a carnivore nor a omnivore the grass and the pinecone they are worms they are decomposers and they make compost for gardens and plants a red worm is a decomposer
myst_022201_2014-12-10_10-43-55_LS_1.3_009_comb it means to be a consumer that you eat other living things to survive the producers make their own food by photosynthesis the consumers eat other living things and the decomposers eat dead plants and animals to be a carnivore means that you only eat meat and no plant
myst_022201_2014-12-10_10-43-55_LS_1.3_005_comb the producers make their own food by photosynthesis the consumers eat other living things and the decomposers eat dead plants and animals so the world will not be as messy there we go the mushrooms i think that this fox is a carnivore lungs and yes it is in the respiratory system
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-46-59_LS_3.4_004_comb the dog is circulatory system and the human is circulatory system are different but almost the same that is our heart and some of our blood is going into our heart and some of it is going out the respiratory system is how you breathe a is the blood vessels blood goes through blood vessels and goes into the heart and it goes out of the heart
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-46-59_LS_3.4_016_comb c is the blood and it is the blood stream where the blood goes and where it comes from i see two h twenty coming going out of the that is about the air going into the body and going out it is the circulatory system
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-46-59_LS_3.4_010_comb a is the blood vessels b is the heart and the and the and c is the blood stream air comes into the body by the mouth and the nose i think that blood goes into the heart some blood goes into the heart and some blood comes out of the heart
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-46-59_LS_3.4_006_comb c two is being brought into the system and h twenty and two is going out into the cells the diaphragm the diaphragm i think that the heart pumps blood throughout your body so that you can breathe that it is all about breathing the blue part is the cells and the red part that the blood is going through is the capillaries
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-46-59_LS_3.4_008_comb the blue part is the cells and the red part that the blood is going through is the capillary that all the big balls of blue are brain cells we have talked about yeast is a single cell while the while the human body and plants have many different parts of cells it is showing us where the mouth is
myst_022201_2014-12-16_11-51-01_LS_2.3_025_comb that is where you where the food is stored until it goes into the intestines we both have a digestive system the cells are different than than each other that is where you chew your food to help it go down your go down to your esophagus and into your stomach and then into your intestines that you can get it back out
myst_022201_2014-12-16_11-51-01_LS_2.3_023_comb the esophagus the esophagus get the food down that you broke down from your mouth and it get it gets it down into your stomach the cells in the human are all bunched together and it is the entire body and the leaf cell is just one part it is showing the butterfly is digestive system and the human is digestive system
myst_022201_2014-12-16_11-51-01_LS_2.3_019_comb this is showing us many parts of the body like the intestines and the lung the plant has many many cells inside of it it help gets the food that you have that you chewed up with your teeth and saliva into another part of your digestive system there are many brain cells that are blue
myst_022201_2014-12-16_11-51-01_LS_2.3_016_comb the butterfly has cells in its body and in its wings the intestines is where your food go comes from your stomach and it goes into your intestines to help it break down even more so that it can get out of your anus that it is pink that humans have a lot more parts to the to the body than yeast does
myst_022201_2014-12-16_11-51-01_LS_2.3_028_comb they travel the food to help it get out skin cells help you body help cuts and things you need muscles the digestive system is all about breaking down your food so you can swallow it and get it back out of your body many blue cells that look like skin
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_010_comb it is showing us that if you water a plant that that helps the plant grow good how are you producers are important because if they were not there then some animals would have nothing to eat and they would die the full animal cracker is not a i do not know actually so you tell me
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_015_comb the plant needs nutrients to survive as well one of the plants is in its dormant stage and that is where it is not fully grown and it is not exactly healthy and one is out of its dormant stage where it is fully grown healthy and not dead because it has everything like sun air and water
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_024_comb the plant got sun and air but it got no water so it started to die that is wind the picture of the cloud is wind and if the wind is too heavy the plants will die yeast is a fungus the picture and the house and that is that plants can be indoors but they are preferably supposed to be outside
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_009_comb because one of them is in its dormant stage plants need sun to survive and this and since the sun has not been out it made it made the plant wilt
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_030_comb we have talked about yeast needing nutrients and produce and plants needing sunlight air and water to make to live and survive and they and plants make their own food by photosynthesis
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_005_comb i think that the yeast was in it is dormant stage and the cookie was nutrients to help it become out of it is dormant stage and the water was also nutrients this plant has gotten everything including sun air and water so is so it is grown and survived and it is not dying it is good
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_018_comb i think that its basic needs are that when the water goes up through the roots that helps the plants grow and with the light energy goes onto the plant it also helps it grow and the carbon dioxide that is what the plant breathes in and the oxygen goes out so that we can breathe
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_004_comb i think that that is about yeast having to have nutrients to become out to get out of its dormant stage because it has to have some some kind of nutrients like animal crackers which has two main ingredients that it needs to become out of it out of it is dormancy too much sun has been going on so it made the plant wilt i do not know
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_014_comb the sun is sunlight and the plants need sunlight to survive that is something the plant has not been getting any air so it started to die the plants need everything including sun air and water to survive if they do not then they will die and wilt they make their own food by photosynthesis
myst_022201_2014-12-10_11-00-15_LS_2.1_019_comb cause they need to be they need to survive and they need to grow it connects to food webs by the the plant is making their own food so that other things other living things can eat them and then and then and yeah it can defend itself from predator that is a learned behavior
myst_022201_2014-12-15_11-09-10_LS_4.2_007_comb it is adapt one of its adaptation is its shell cause it can help it survive from predator what does classified mean what is an adaptation no i do not think they know how to catch a frisbee when they
myst_022201_2014-12-15_11-09-10_LS_4.2_018_comb the one in the bottom right corner is the person is touching the hot oven which makes the which is a stimulus to the girl to the person making it making it go up immediately cause it is so hot and the one in the upper right corner is no i do not think it is a learned behavior it just happens
myst_022201_2014-12-15_11-09-10_LS_4.2_002_comb there are animals and they all have digestive systems it is a nonlearned behavior we have been learning about digestive system we have not been learning about animals yet the snake has an adaptation about it is rattle and it is sound that makes the girl scared and run away it is showing that the birds are flying and the one in the front is the leader
myst_022201_2014-12-15_11-09-10_LS_4.2_009_comb one of its adaptation is its pattern on its back and on its body so it can be camouflaged in with its habitat this behavior is a person and a doctor and the doctor is hitting their knee to show that to see their their reflection good how are you number two it is teeth number two it is webbed feet
myst_022201_2014-12-15_11-09-10_LS_4.2_015_comb the rattle is the adaptation because the rattle scares the girl which is the it is stimulus an adaptation that the skunk has is its smell that makes the skunk run away because it does not want to smell that it is involving a skunk which is food for the wolf because it they can flap their wings and get the away it is wings for that it can fly away
myst_022201_2014-12-15_11-09-10_LS_4.2_021_comb i think it is behavior is that the that the ducks are getting too cold so they want to go to a warmer place for the this is a nonlearned behavior because they know how to do it immediately so bad
myst_022201_2014-12-15_11-09-10_LS_4.2_026_comb the person touches the hot oven that and it makes it go and it makes it makes the person makes the person is hand go up because it is so hot the cat fell out of the tree
myst_022201_2014-12-15_11-09-10_LS_4.2_022_comb it is behavior is playing because it is happy to be catching the disk we have talked about animal behaviors how they work how how the how stimulates happen and makes animals do things and also human
myst_022201_2014-12-12_11-08-25_LS_4.1_011_comb the mosquito wants to suck the person is blood but the but the same person smacks it because it does not want it is blood being sucked by a mosquito this is showing us that the brain has a big part because she knows that she wants to hit the ball and her body is getting ready to hit it ran away because it was scared that the rattle snake was going to to eat it
myst_022201_2014-12-12_11-08-25_LS_4.1_009_comb once the doorbell rang the dog barked because it wanted to protect it is it is master one is the spinal cord and there is the brain and i do not know the nervous system makes people because they are either startled or they want to do something we have been learning about systems and the digestive system
myst_022201_2014-12-12_11-08-25_LS_4.1_015_comb that is the human body it is about a boy be talking and then he spills over the grape juice and the stimulus is that the grape juice startled the boy so he jumped up good how are you it shows that one bee wants other bees to do things because they need more of something
myst_022201_2014-12-12_11-08-25_LS_4.1_014_comb the dog the doorbell rings and the stimulus is that the dog barked it makes it bark it is showing that the b is collecting pollen and it is bringing pollen back to the honey comb the squirrel comes up to the snake and the rattlesnake hisses because it wants to eat the squirrel but the squirrel does not want to be eaten so it runs away
myst_022201_2014-12-12_11-08-25_LS_4.1_004_comb the dog is sitting the d is collecting pollen and the geese are flying it slaps the mosquito because it does not want to be hurt the brain helps by it by showing the person by telling the person what their thinking about doing and what they are going to do e because i because it is lungs
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-35-53_LS_3.3_015_comb the blood keeps going and the c two that it that is from the heart goes out into the alveolis and the and the two goes into the blood so that it can keep going through the blood stream and it goes back into the heart so that the blood from the two can go into the heart and yeah air comes into the body through through your nose and your mouth
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-35-53_LS_3.3_001_comb good how are you there are tubes that carry air and branch off the trachea and go deep into the lung it is a human body air gets taken into the body by when you inhale it from your mouth and from your nose this is telling you parts of the human body and the
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-35-53_LS_3.3_006_comb this is about air going into your body and going into the lungs and then going back out so that you can breathe i do not know the exchange of gases is all about c two going out into your body because your body can not use that but two comes in because you need that to breathe i do not know i do not know i do not know
myst_022201_2014-12-17_11-35-53_LS_3.3_007_comb breathing is all about living you have to breathe to be able to live the grass and the pinecone they make they make stuff that you put in gardens to help your plants grow some of the animals like the shark eats some of the other animals that are in the it is a herbivore
myst_022201_2014-12-01_11-17-24_LS_1.3_014_comb i do not know what you are ask it tells me that they make other they make things for the earth that help it grow some of them only eat meat some of them only eat grass some of them eat both they do not eat anything else because they make their own food is a decomposer and it makes things for the earth think that an omnivore means you eat plants and animals
myst_022201_2014-12-01_11-17-24_LS_1.3_003_comb all of these things are systems which are like animals things or bacteria dead plants and animals a producer means that it gives humans or other living organisms things to breathe and eat they are all systems a plant breathes in c twenty which is what we breathe out and they breathe out air which is what we breathe in
myst_022201_2014-12-01_11-17-24_LS_1.3_007_comb can you repeat the question consumer is when whatever the consumer is is what it eats things they are eating they they will dead leaves and the newspapers to make them compost can you repeat the question it is a food chain of many different it helps plants grow dead plants and animals
myst_022201_2014-12-01_11-17-24_LS_1.3_017_comb because if they were not existing then every plant and animal would take forever to be dead fully and not be in the world and if they were then the world would be a very very very dirty place a herbivore only eats plants you help plants grow worms decompose it and make it compost they eat other living thing i think a decomposer is
myst_022201_2014-12-01_11-17-24_LS_1.3_027_comb i think he is a a composer it you have you are trying to start propeller and when you let go the the airplane will go and when it stops starts the number of the distance
myst_996426_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.2_002_comb we were making some airplanes and we and we were trying to make sure what ha ha the distance was for the airplane
myst_996426_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.2_011_comb cause for paperclips which is the passengers are making the airplane go slower cause the more passengers there are the more slower it gets
myst_996426_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.2_008_comb one side is down more and a little bit more and the other side is a little bit upper well the flight line is so that so the airplane can move on to anything what was it again
myst_996426_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_024_comb there are twenty swings and that is and that swings is about twenty centimeters the number of swings and the pendulum na lengths and is it was about like twelve or nine
myst_996426_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_005_comb we have been making airplanes and everything the on the left side s how many swings it was we were swinging them around and counting and counting how long they swung is the number of it is so good a cork and yeah
myst_996426_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_006_comb and zero and we also measured how how long it how long the distances was just a little bit the item and it is measuring how far up it is flipping i can not really explain it it is hard a little bit
myst_996426_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_012_comb well i think the kids or somebody is measuring how far the the the item is going which is forty centimeters and the big one is is bouncing off the wall and on to the ground
myst_996426_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_017_comb the the little one is bouncing off the wall and a fishing line a pops juice popsicle sticks and two straws which we punch holes in and well we what we did was just making the plane but we did not get to finish it
myst_996426_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_005_comb first the airplane and we are making and we were making him some boats a little paddle thing for the wind thing for the front it moves the plane we have not tried the plane yet we had that will i do not know
myst_996426_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_021_comb it kept it it went it went in circles cause to move m move the air do not really know cause i have not tried it yet
myst_996426_2009-24-09_00-00-00_VB_3.1_020_comb the rubber band is on the bottom and so that the it could hold the the little paddle thing and i do not know i do not really know the airplane is going up the line
myst_996430_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_018_comb well this is the way we had done it in science class so it is pretty familiar and that makes it familiar with i am familiar with it and so then it would have can you hear me we have been testing planes
myst_996430_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_008_comb the higher or the more passengers it can carry i mean five different boats it is showing on where each capacity goes and how much passengers it can hold the y line was where you put the number of passengers and the x line was where we we have not learned about that
myst_996430_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_006_comb we tested how the size of the boat or the capacity of the boat made the number of passengers go up variables and then we graphed about them the higher the capacity of the boat the more capacity it had the more passengers it could hold
myst_996430_2009-23-09_00-00-00_VB_2.3_024_comb twenty-five if they both get twenty-five passengers that can not be right the more passengers that you put on that you have you might change those s some other time
myst_996430_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_006_comb if you change too many and then you get a different result you do not know which one caused that result you just think zero i just got a different result which one did it if you change like the material and the width and the capacity of the boat it might just throw it off totally
myst_996430_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_011_comb if you put it in too hard it might sink it before it is good and also we have been testing lifeboats made out of half a paper cup
myst_996430_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_015_comb if you have a bigger boat you are probably going to be able to hold more maybe if you changed the material a bit you might be able to hold more like may be if you made it out of plastic that floats better than paper so maybe that will hold more and maybe if it is wider it will hold more we only tested one variable at a time and we tested the size of the boat the each cup
myst_996430_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_017_comb i do not really know the bigger the capacity the more passengers it can hold so that probably has something to do with it i do not really know cause i was not here on thursday so i do not know the whole thing
myst_996430_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_010_comb each of the each of the things when all the pennies added together went just a little over the total amount of the milliliters like on number eight on eighty milliliters it had forty-five passengers so that goes over the half mark
myst_996430_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_002_comb you already asked me that question if you put it in all on one side it would sink earlier than usual we are testing four different types of boat and then we are testing the number of passengers each one can hold and then we are doing graphing a we did graphing today i did not know what we did on thursday cause i was not here
myst_996430_2009-21-09_00-00-00_VB_2.2_018_comb mostly the standard procedures are to just make a controlled ex experiment and control all the variables then they will really just help you what we did was so we measured the number the capacity of it doing in milliliters and then we tested how many pennies it could hold
myst_996430_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_008_comb it goes down and then comes back a little bit lower to make it go faster or slower
myst_996430_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_015_comb the eighteen centimeter would would make it go a lot quicker the thirty-eight centimeter is when we tested it is about a little quicker than a second and the one hundred the one hundred centimeter would probably be a little bit longer than the well it would be longer than a s second cause you will have to go farther up and then farther down
myst_996430_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_007_comb it goes back and forth every time it hits the opposite side it comes back they are all about keeping time so they would be connected to a pole have a piece of string and then a bob which is a weight on the bottom so then it would move side to side hopefully exactly the time of a second
myst_996430_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_013_comb you can make the string longer or shorter make the bob heavier or lighter make the the holder tilted or up tilted up or down it moves almost the exact time as a second goes and after a while it starts to slow down
myst_996430_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_004_comb this is what a pendulum looks like this is the type that we made in class a few days ago we have been learning about pendulums and how to keep time like a grandfather clock would do you can make it heavier or lighter or make it a different color
myst_996430_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_016_comb the lighter one would be a little bit it would it would go a lot longer than the heaviest one cause the heaviest one you have more gravity pulling down on it
myst_996430_2009-03-09_00-00-00_VB_1.1_010_comb string is holding the bob and then it is attached to the a pencil or a wire or something that is attached to the string and then it is tied to the pendulum or tied to the bob
myst_996430_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_013_comb the one on number twenty there is more of them e but they are all in the middle so it is sinking it a lot more than number twelve with twelve of them and then three pennies cause they are all spread out they are not all in one spot they are a little spread out so then it spreads the weight evenly and will not flip over
myst_996430_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_019_comb there would not be enough weight on it and then it would also just like sink after like five pennies cause they might all move to one side so that is a big factor of it if you put it in really hard you would sink the boat
myst_996430_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_016_comb number a could probably hold more cause it is a lot bigger number num letter d could probably hold the least amount cause it is the smallest and therefore it would hit it would go a lot less time without it sinking
myst_996430_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_021_comb if you are off and then you test another one that is like just a teeny bit off you might get a different result so you want to be as accurate as you can we just started yeah we just well if there are really big waves it would like flip the boat maybe so it is a lot better if there is just a lot of flat water
myst_996430_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_010_comb it would not really make a difference the materials it is made out of the how wide it is the height of it and the material it is floating in like water
myst_996430_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_008_comb maybe the higher it is the more passengers it can hold cause then the water would have it would have to go lower and lower until a certain and then the water would flow over and like the smaller it is the less weight it can hold
myst_996430_2009-14-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_003_comb lifeboats we are making them and they are just a paper cup so we cut them in half and then we put pennies in em to see how many it can put in before it stops floating they are both going the same height one centimeter with the stick in
myst_996430_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_012_comb this picture is that the the top one it is i mean both of them are out loose at the same length but the cork is on the on the top of and the cork is on the second centimeter in between the first and the second and then the bottom one is in where the cork is supposed to be
myst_996430_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_019_comb if you changed more than one variable you you will you will never know which one would be right so you you would not have a controlled experiment that is changing more than one variable that is you do not have a c controlled experiment which then you do not know the almost all the exact things
myst_996430_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_008_comb whether the flipper base is is over here and then it looks like it is once the stick is one centimeter out and it shows the way it like with the line the way it shot how high and how far and it shot forty centimeters it is showing how high it went which is about twenty-eight centimeters high
myst_996430_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_005_comb well we heard of the flipper base and and then we had the flipper s the flipper stick which was flipping the cork and then the flipper base was on they are all the same angle and the object
myst_996430_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_015_comb the circular ball is probably the heaviest cause it is wooden so is the wooden cork but the cork is a little lighter than the wooden ball both of them are and then the foil the the mini foil is probably the lightest thing it was on a plastic angle holder
myst_996430_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_020_comb well you can see with the large foil ball it is it is lower distance in length and then the smaller one is higher so you want it just pick one of them all the other variables should stay the same you should not mess with them cause you are you are testing just like how far the things will go not different ways
myst_996430_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_003_comb we have been working with flipper base and we are shooting flipper bases we are shooting things the bottom one will probably go farther cause it is in the right place and then the top one will probably just go a little ways
myst_996430_2009-08-10_00-00-00_VB_4.3_014_comb the corks would probably go the same length then the wooden ball might go the farthest cause like the cork is can bounce any way like they could b bounce back but the c the circular ball could just keep on rolling forward and then same with both of the foil balls the fifteen centimeter one did twenty swings
myst_996430_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_004_comb because i had a longer string and they had a sho lot lot shorter string it is showing the length of the string and how many it did like the shortest string did twenty swings it has to travel a longer distance to get to the other side and back yes it does
myst_996430_2009-09-09_00-00-00_VB_1.3_002_comb we have been studying pendulums and today we did how does the length of string make it different we did not make a graph i have been studying pendulums they keep time kind of like on a grandfather clock they keep time
myst_996430_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_004_comb we tied a string to a paperclip and then put a penny inside the paperclip and then after that we tied well we taped the end of the string to the to the amount of centimeters and then made a little loop taped it and then attached it to a pencil
myst_996430_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_009_comb the shorter eighteen centimeter one would swing a lot faster and then probably the thirty-eight centimeter one would probably just be pretty normal and then the one hundred centimeter pendulum would probably go the least amount of times
myst_996430_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_008_comb you are only changing one variable at a time you are changing the length of the pendulum not the length and the weight of the bob that would be a bad experiment we found out that the longer the string makes it slower and the shorter the string makes it a lot longer
myst_996430_2009-10-09_00-00-00_VB_1.2_006_comb the bob is the thing at the bottom of the pendulum and we found out the lighter it is the faster it would swing cause then there is not as much gravity pulling it down it seems like it goes a lot higher than it goes farther how high it goes
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_021_comb well those are variables if like well mostly the object is a variable because like if it is heavier if it is a lot lot heavier then it would predict i predict that the higher it goes or the lighter it is the higher and farther it goes
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_018_comb the flipper base holds the stick and the the stick you would push down and you would have the cork on it and then when you let go it shoots the cork what they are is they are kinda like catapults you push down on you can shoot a a cork you can shoot a ball you can shoot
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_015_comb what i think is the higher the angle the farther it will shoot no not yet but i think i know it will happen just a little bit make you able to shoot it looks like you are shooting it from the you are shooting the ball tin foil forty centimeters from the flipper
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_017_comb the the s stick is pushed in about half the way so then it shoots pretty hard right now it is showing how high it goes and you can also you can do a heavier or lighter object n of the four
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_038_comb well what i am seeing is that the closer you have it in the higher it goes so about at one centimeter it goes the highest and then it goes to two centimeters which goes a little bit lower we have been testing variables on little planes that we have made
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_011_comb the diff at a different angle maybe the heavier goes higher or no the heavier goes lower cause it weighs a lot more well the lengths of the sticks are each a centimeter apart
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_025_comb probably the farther you put it in like closer to the one centimeters that are out if he had one centimeter out it would probably go higher up or it would probably go the farthest then it would not go as far if it was a lot heavier but if it was not that heavy it would probably go the farthest the lighter the lightest would go the farthest
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_032_comb how much the you have the corks which will probably be shot out of the catapult you have the flipper base where you put the stick in and you have the stick that will sh shoot the corks and then you have the angler which you would put it in
myst_996430_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_012_comb i thought that the bigger the angle that you have it at the the farther it would go r is the same so that is good and also but all you did is change the winds so probably fifty winds would go probably the farthest
myst_996430_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_007_comb what i think this is about is you would put like five and like for an example if you had one passenger and it went nine feet or eight feet you would draw a dot right there no you put the distance on the x axis and you put the passengers on the y axis
myst_996430_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_009_comb well i do not really know they would go on the y axis i do not really know that how to explain that question
myst_996430_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_011_comb it seems like the more motors that you had the farther it went like on five motors it went about seven hundred and seventy-five feet or inches or centimeters so it went pretty far with the bigger and or more motors
myst_996430_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_015_comb the y axis is always like the top one and that is where you put the distance the information that you have get you have gathered in the experiment that you just did you would put like the number of passengers on the y axis and then distance would go on the x axis
myst_996430_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_002_comb we had made them out of straws popsicle sticks and propellers and the propellers would be attached to a rubberband and they would spin to power the plane it is a graph with an x and y axis they both count by ones and go all the way up to ten i do not know what that is
myst_996430_2009-01-10_00-00-00_VB_3.4_014_comb it is always on the bottom and it is like the number of passengers or the motor we did not really learn that this time that we did science because then you will not like get to like have the energy and charging electronics and how long i get see that heat energy is burning the wax so the wax melts and that called be a
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-46-44_EE_1.4_001_comb i am doing good really good we have been learning about how light bulbs could light up and parallel circuit could you repeat that again i see a little candle that is on fire and it is melting from the or from the heat
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-46-44_EE_1.4_005_comb we have been learning about energy and the wire it relates to heat energy and it yeah that you have to have motor the wires are connected to the side it will not to the wires connected to the bulb so if you flip it it goes the direction of the other way
myst_007087_2014-02-06_08-02-23_EE_1.1_008_comb you have to put one on the bottom and then on the side of the light bulb so the d cell so you have to put the and postive side and then you put middle piece to the bottom and then the side and then to make it lighter
myst_007087_2014-02-06_08-02-23_EE_1.1_002_comb i ve been learning about speaker two he have hum circuit moves and motor is work and have to light up light bulb to carry the electricity to the wire to make the light bulb lighter the wire is like they make all the electricity one from another the blue dots represent ah umm the electricity a flipped over so
myst_007087_2014-02-06_08-02-23_EE_1.1_019_comb light bulbs is about how you could ah m would it light upto room and has gas in it is so you could light up from the energy it put light up anymore which is what meant to be i don t know yeah the electricity is flowing from the negative side to the back
myst_007087_2014-02-06_08-02-23_EE_1.1_020_comb a light bulb is received by because ah umm it receives like either money or energy or electricity short could light up the wires carry hum electricity show the batteries the light bulb could light up because the electricity is not flowing to the bulb right
myst_007087_2014-02-06_08-02-23_EE_1.1_023_comb the battery is received no the light bulb is receiving the energy from the the light bulb its flowing to the positive side to that so you why they are called wires it means that ah umm the wires carry the ah electricity to the to the ah to the light bulb to light up
myst_007087_2014-02-06_08-02-23_EE_1.1_036_comb the components have to be called ah umm one wire has to be connected to the negative side of the battery and then other wire has to be connected to the positive wire and if the positive wire has to be to the bottom of it and then the negative side possibly on the side of the battery
myst_007087_2014-02-06_08-02-23_EE_1.1_013_comb it will shut off and and the light will hum turn the electricity that flows to light up the light bulb the point that the energy is flowing out of the negative side i am doing good wire battery and the light what is your name again
myst_007087_2014-02-06_08-02-23_EE_1.1_035_comb the d cell battery ah umm is omitted is put in the electricity into the positive the negative side and if it is flowing to the to the battery and then it is flowing out of the battery to the positive side so that it just keeps on rotating so it can it makes it a circuit that
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-52-03_EE_2.1_008_comb it is a complete circuit and the the pathway is the wires the pathways going to the the bottom of the light bulb and the side of the light bulb and then it get is brighter
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-52-03_EE_2.1_010_comb it is flowing to the battery the two light bulbs and the pathway it is flowing to the two light bulbs the battery the positive side and the negative side and the wires the blue dots are electricity just for your information i am actually doing pretty good
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-52-03_EE_2.1_025_comb the one d cell is brighter than the other and when you take away a light bulb it is not a complete circuit when you like do not put when you do not have the negative side connecting to the positive side that will not make it flow
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-52-03_EE_2.1_002_comb we have been doing we have been doing we have been doing then that how the magnets can produce energy to and also and also like
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-52-03_EE_2.1_021_comb one is one is that you one is dim with with one battery and the two batteries is the battery the light bulbs are very bright can you repeat that again it got brighter the bulbs are getting dimmer i do not know the blue dot are electricity
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-52-03_EE_2.1_029_comb if you have a positive side and a negative side connected together bye have a good day i do not ah i do not know
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-52-03_EE_2.1_011_comb it flows through the positive side and the negative side through the wires to the battery to the to the to the battery to the battery and then the next wire you
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-52-03_EE_2.1_027_comb when you click on it negative side and on negative side the negative side and the negative side will not flow but when you are clicking on it again the and the negative side will flow the motor turns by the d cell the solar panel is collecting sun light which is energy to bring to the wires to the motors so the motor can run
myst_007087_2014-02-12_09-44-30_EE_1.2_003_comb the d cell is connected to the wires which is travel the wire is traveling to the motor to make the motor flags spin can you repeat it can you repeat that again the switch in the picture is so like it burnt on it i do not know zero yeah
myst_007087_2014-02-12_09-44-30_EE_1.2_034_comb the pictures showing that though it is like a different setup that we did with the back with the light bulb and so what we are using like sss yeah well we have been watching how to to the motor and the circuits with the back detail d cell
myst_007087_2014-02-12_09-44-30_EE_1.2_029_comb what bring electricity into the motor so the motor could spin i do not know it stops moving can you repeat that again so like are you asking like so like one it is like so you are you asking like one it is closed it is is running again
myst_007087_2014-02-12_09-44-30_EE_1.2_023_comb it does not leave or it does not make the electricity on flow to the motor am i correct it like it likes the sun like it is like bringing electricity so the hm the motor could move can you repeat that again
myst_007087_2014-02-12_09-44-30_EE_1.2_007_comb a wire is took that they to the positive side and the negative side the wires have to be connected to the motor the battery does that bring the battery brings the electricity to the motor from the one it is closed because the electricity is not going to the motor a but one i closed it will it is close open
myst_007087_2014-02-12_09-44-30_EE_1.2_008_comb the electricity is bringing back to the motor and the on d cell i noticed that the switch is close that the motor keeps on it spins and the motor starts spinning again i do not know because we have a go gone outside and used it yet it is the motor spins that
myst_007087_2014-02-26_11-38-01_EE_1.3_009_comb i do not know okay bye mornie what is that your name i do not know conductors are a part that could actually make the motors run or not run okay you get in that mornie i noticed that it is not spinning because it is not touching the metal part
myst_007087_2014-02-26_11-38-01_EE_1.3_002_comb we have been learning about how to complete circuits and how to complete motor complete circuit i can told you that the insulators or objects that make the motor run or not work i found out that all the metal parts and wood and all the plastic parts and the wood and the sponze
myst_007087_2014-02-26_11-38-01_EE_1.3_005_comb a conductor like produces so like you do not have to touch the wires to the to the motor so it just gives you better resources so you get at this mornie okay er i do not know
myst_007087_2014-02-26_11-38-01_EE_1.3_017_comb i noticed that the i noticed that some objects are making the motor spin conductors are other parts that would make the motor run the all the metal plates are going to work and all the plate that are not metal were not work
myst_007087_2014-03-20_12-44-38_EE_1.1_003_comb you just be i do not like the and the positve side i am doing bad today what you say about the mass is each of the different piles weigh something and you just add them and that is the weight of the big pile mixed the mass is getting bigger you are mixing the salt with the water and it dissolves we have been learning about mixtures and solutions good how are you
myst_014015_2013-12-16_13-42-18_MX_1.2_011_comb what the solute roles plays in the solution is it is the one that dissolves the mass becomes greater because you add the water plus the salt that means it is a solution the salt dissolved
myst_014015_2013-12-16_13-42-18_MX_1.2_008_comb the role the water is playing in this picture is what does not dissolve it is considered a mixture it means when you mix things it makes the weight more when the salt is added to the cup on the right it makes it way more i do not know i am sorry the salt will dissolve in the water can you please repeat that madam could you please repeat that
myst_014015_2013-12-16_13-42-18_MX_1.2_005_comb we call them a solute you use a screen excuse me madam but why do you keep repeating the animation you are mixing these two substances together the salt dissolves in the water on the right they are all mixed that means when the solute is mixed with the water it is still there so it still has weight
myst_014015_2013-12-16_13-42-18_MX_1.2_039_comb well the water goes away and the salt is shown again and it turns into a a salt crystal it is a can you please show the animation again madam the sand stays in the cup and the salt dissolves the mass has become greater the trail mix is getting separated you call it a mix good how are you
myst_014015_2013-12-13_08-34-42_MX_1.1_007_comb the pile on the left is mixed and the pile on the right are separated on the screen it is showing trying to separate the two mixtures the trail mix separate into different i can identify salad beans and paper clips and they are mixed together they changed because they got separated the water and the marbles are getting separated
myst_014015_2013-12-13_08-34-42_MX_1.1_013_comb they are getting into separate groups it is filtering out the marbles we have been learning about mixtures and solutions what happened is it went back together and it is important because it did not stay what is happening is it is getting into groups and it is important cause it is not a mixture anymore you can mix them together in the picture it shows things that are mixed together
myst_014015_2013-12-13_08-34-42_MX_1.1_015_comb they are being separated i am horrible today thanks for asking we have been learning about mixtures and solutions and how they are separated cup of salt water solution on the right is twenty grams and the cup of salt water solution on the left is ten grams by the shade of the glass i am sorry marney i do not know
myst_014015_2013-12-17_12-31-54_MX_2.2_007_comb the cup on the right is twenty grams and the cup on the left if ten grams sorry i just have to the first is the most concentrated and the second is the least concentrated
myst_014015_2013-12-17_12-31-54_MX_2.2_018_comb i think the solution that is most least concentrated is number two i believe number on is the most concentrated what i think will happen is the cup on the right will weigh more when you put it in so it will go towards that way i am sorry i do not know i did well in my prediction my prediction was correct the grape drink is the mix and the salt water is a solution because you put more grams in the right cup
myst_014015_2013-12-17_12-31-54_MX_2.2_013_comb they are different the rock weighs ninety grams and the feather weighs two grams so the rock weighs more they are both the solute you mixed two substances together to make a chemical reaction they are making a chemical reaction you are weighing the chemicals thing because one bag is open and the other is not i knew that question zero it is still on
myst_014015_2014-02-10_13-22-45_MX_4.2_004_comb you are mixing the water with the substance a gas was create the bag closed weighs more i am i do not know i am sorry there was a chemical reaction so it bubbled one of the masses weighs more we were learning about gases i see a reactant you identified the crystals it is an addition problem
myst_014015_2014-02-10_13-22-45_MX_4.2_006_comb i see a chemical reaction what makes it happen is a mixture of two different substances good how are you one will be heavier my prediction was correct what i noticed was the twenty grams of solute and the seventy-five millimeters of water were more the difference i see is the solute we are seeing which one is heavier number one is the most concentrated and number three is the least concentrated
myst_014015_2014-01-13_13-59-27_MX_2.2_011_comb because one cup has twenty grams of solute and another cup has ten grams of solute what is has to do with what we are doing in science is the grape drink mix the lighter one is the one with more water and the salt water solution well they are equal how you can determine is by tasting them the concentration is different
myst_014015_2014-01-13_13-59-27_MX_2.2_007_comb what i noticed is the seventy-five milliliter water on the right has twenty grams of solute and the one on the left has ten grams of solute you can taste them solution one is the most concentrated and solution two is the least concentrated number one is most concentrated and number two is least concentrated we have been learning about solutions
myst_014015_2014-01-13_13-59-27_MX_2.2_012_comb they both have the same amount of water when you add spacers then it weakens the magnetic field the magnet is attracting the paperclip through the thin stack when there is too much of weight on the other side of the balance scale the magnetic force it s too weak to pull the magnets together well to increase the distance you add spacers
myst_004031_2014-02-03_09-33-01_EE_3.4_002_comb we ve been talking about the force of attraction breaking with a way well the magnetic field makes the magnets attract but the spacers keep the magnetic force from attracting well when you try to separate the magnets if there is too much weight then the magnetic force doesn t work
myst_004031_2014-02-03_09-33-01_EE_3.4_018_comb it makes it takes less washers to break the force of magnetism when you add spacers it interacts with the magnetic field making it weaker because its farther away
myst_004031_2014-02-03_09-33-01_EE_3.4_011_comb well if the spacers in there is making the magnetic force stronger so the strong magnetic field is weaker because the spacer are separating them so washers are being thrown into a cup which is breaking the force of attraction with weight
myst_004031_2014-02-03_09-33-01_EE_3.4_007_comb well when you drop in washers then it is weighing down the magnetic force which is making it weaker because the weight is stronger than the magnetic force it makes the magnets repel each other it makes the force weak there is not enough attraction force because it is too thick
myst_004031_2014-02-03_09-33-01_EE_3.4_015_comb the force of magnetism is very strong but as you put in more of those spacers it weakens the force because of distance there are zero spacers and zero washers if you add spacers it makes that the magnetic field further away from
myst_004031_2013-12-17_09-36-57_EE_2.2_005_comb well in a parallel circuit so one wire goes one set of wire goes to one of the lightbulbs and the other set of wires goes to the other lightbulb i ve been learning about series and parallel circuits it would make the bulb brighter because then there would be more energy to flow in yes there are two the top circuits are shining brighter because there is more energy
myst_004031_2013-12-17_09-36-57_EE_2.2_011_comb the series circuit has less of an energy flow because because both light bulbs are connected in one pathway in a parallel circuit has more energy because they are connected in two pathways the bulb will get brighter each bulb has its own pathway each bulb has its own pathway
myst_004031_2013-12-17_09-36-57_EE_2.2_014_comb the ban then the energy flows out of the negative terminal of the battery and into the positive terminal of the battery the energy is flowing out of the negative terminal and into the positive terminal
myst_004031_2013-12-17_09-36-57_EE_2.2_016_comb well the energy is flowing out of the negative through the first lightbulb bulb base and then into the second lightbulb s bulb base back through from the casing to the other bulb s casing it back into the positive side of a terminal there is one pathway so it s a series circuit
myst_004031_2013-12-17_09-36-57_EE_2.2_019_comb so the pathway of electricity both come out of the battery through in separate paths to the lightbulbs and back into the battery well the energy flow out two ways in the negative terminal and then flows in two ways into the positive
myst_004031_2013-12-17_09-36-57_EE_2.2_009_comb well both of the the parallel in a simple circuit both have more energy for the bulbs while the series circuit depth less because it flows through both bulbs in one circuit instead of split into half it only has one bulb this is not a parallel circuit it s a series circuit because each bulb is connected in the same circuit
myst_004031_2013-12-17_09-36-57_EE_2.2_010_comb because there s two pathways in a parallel circuit there is one in a series circuit and there is still one in a simple circuit except there is less components there is one d cell and two bulbs well the person is burning calories walking up a mountain
myst_004031_2013-12-03_10-12-27_EE_1.4_021_comb well the gas is polluting and food wind water and solar energy do not like they don t release pollution they re both renewable and they can always be used while gas and coal are non renewable and may run out some day
myst_004031_2013-12-03_10-12-27_EE_1.4_013_comb yes you can because energy is going through that drum to make it release a sound it will be all polluted so that is why we should use like solar energy and wind energy and even water the energy force makes a boom or some kind of noise that shows energy is present she is moving
myst_004031_2013-12-03_10-12-27_EE_1.4_010_comb a person is beating the drum is making sound energy a heat is emitting from the wick quick and it is also giving off light the environment will not be polluted i am not sure
myst_004031_2013-12-03_10-12-27_EE_1.4_003_comb energy is power that we use to put things in to motion or light or sound sounds like some things is sizzle we have been doing some experiments with like heat ice sort of thing and like crank energy they re both environmentally friendly and they both need outdoor thing
myst_004031_2013-12-03_10-12-27_EE_1.4_025_comb it will pollute the air and most of the environment and release smog it releases pollution into the air they polluting the earth while solar panels do not pollute the earth it will be environmentally from a candle burning heat it is flickering giving off heat and making light light and heat
myst_004031_2013-12-03_10-12-27_EE_1.4_006_comb burning flames and you also see wax melting well when you flip the d cell the energy i think still flows the same way i have been learning about circuits and energy flow through light bulbs and motors
myst_004031_2013-11-18_09-33-09_EE_1.1_027_comb well it looks like that the energy is flowing through the negative side of the d cell through the light bulb and back through the d cell positive so the provides the energy for the for the electricity for the components to carry it through and transfer it represent the electrons flowing through
myst_004031_2013-11-18_09-33-09_EE_1.1_004_comb well the parts in a circuit put put the circuit together so without parts those components a there is there is no such thing as a circuit a circuit is just like a pathway for the energy to flow well electricity flows into the d cell on the positive terminal from the light bulb wires carry the energy to certain parts
myst_004031_2013-11-18_09-33-09_EE_1.1_014_comb the light bulb takes the energy and makes the filament in there get so hot that it will produce light think that one of the contact points would not get touched and the light bulb would turn off the components have to be connected to all the the right contact points to get the circuit to flow the right way
myst_004031_2013-11-18_09-33-09_EE_1.1_023_comb well if you flip it i think it will still travel through the bulb and the bulb will still light on the d cell i notice the electrons flowing out of the and in through the positive the light bulb turns on the d cell gives power into the circuit
myst_004031_2013-11-18_09-33-09_EE_1.1_016_comb see the energy flowing through the wires through the light bulb filament well so the the energy comes out of the d cell through the wires it touches the bulb casing goes through the filament and comes out through the bulb base into the positive terminal of the battery these have stored energy inside them and are used to power a
myst_004031_2013-11-18_09-33-09_EE_1.1_026_comb the setup is that a wire touches the negative terminal of the d cell and then that same wire touches the bulb casing of the light bulb and then with a positive terminal another wire touches there and that same wire touches the bulb base the d cell is the source of energy
myst_004031_2013-11-18_09-33-09_EE_1.1_021_comb well so it so the negative terminal produces the energy and the positive side collects the energy so the energy is coming out the negative side and in through the positive side light bulb receives the energy from the battery means that energy is flowing through the circuit
myst_004031_2013-11-18_09-33-09_EE_1.1_010_comb wires carry the electricity between components or energy if the d cell were not there the the bulb would not light up because there is no energy the positive side is receiving the energy that comes out of the negative side the light bulbs are like the the evidence of the energy transfer and give off light
myst_004031_2014-01-08_09-03-47_EE_2.3_012_comb the energy is flowing but one bulb is burnt out so guess what happens the rest other bulbs are off too until you replace that the burnt bulb no energy is flowing then all the bulbs go out of there in a series circuit
myst_004031_2014-01-08_09-03-47_EE_2.3_003_comb strings of light are supposed to be connected in parallel circuits so that they don t went shut of all the bulbs when one bulb burns out a series circuit might be like this because it s got one pathway that leads through all the components
myst_004031_2014-01-08_09-03-47_EE_2.3_021_comb it s parallel circuits so when one bulb burns out then the other one still keeps working because there s two pathways filament broke so so the other bulb goes off too if it s a series this a series circuit and one bulb is burnt out so the other one goes off the light turns on because of the they are all connected in pathways
myst_004031_2014-01-08_09-03-47_EE_2.3_025_comb the energy stops flowing because the bulb is burnt which is like an open circuit it s a series is a parallel circuit it s not in series so when one burns out the rest keep working because one pathway breaks and the rest of the pathways are still flowing one filament is burnt out so the other bulb is off too
myst_004031_2014-01-08_09-03-47_EE_2.3_030_comb because the filament burns out and like opens the circuit like an open switch series circuits are in the strings of light and when a bulb burns out then all the lights go out on the string all the components are connected in one pathway it s a simple circuit and there is and the switch is open
myst_004031_2014-01-08_09-03-47_EE_2.3_010_comb the other bulb burns this is a series circuit with energy flowing into the filament burns out so because the filament burns out then the other bulb turns off it s easy to find the one that s burnt out so you can easily replace it the other bulb gets brighter because the energy has doesn t have to share and it stays on
myst_004031_2014-01-08_09-03-47_EE_2.3_019_comb well when a bulb goes out the electricity flow stops the other one goes out too because one of that the filament is burnt up so it s like in open switch the the filament is not connected for energy to flow a filament breaks and opens the pathway
myst_004031_2014-01-08_09-03-47_EE_2.3_009_comb strings of lights in series circuits and series circuits are connected in one pathway so if the filament in a bulb burns out it s like in open switch so no energy can flow through the circuit the magnet north and south poles attracting someone using a compass to find in what direction they are going
myst_004031_2014-01-24_09-55-09_EE_3.2_008_comb both poles are the same both poles they are close to each other are the same when the opposite poles is close to each other they will attract but when the same poles are close to each other they will repel the magnets are repelling each other because the poles are the same
myst_004031_2014-01-24_09-55-09_EE_3.2_009_comb well they have opposite poles and those opposite poles are just think they like each other they want to attract well the north and south pole magnets are attracting the south and south and north and north poles on the magnets are repelling
myst_004031_2014-01-24_09-55-09_EE_3.2_013_comb it pose the magnetic flow of the melting metal that is deep inside the earth they will repel each other because it will be north pole against north pole or south pole against south pole it s a compass showing you north on the earth
myst_004031_2014-01-24_09-55-09_EE_3.2_010_comb the magnets are floating because there they don t want to be close to the other magnets so they are repelling we ve been learning about when two what happens when two magnets interact
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_019_comb magnet stick to steel and iron because they because magnets only stick to iron steel is iron with carbon and aluminum has no iron the magnet is made out of iron the nail is steel which sticks to magnet and the block is wood which will not stick
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_010_comb magnets only sticks to magnetic materials that have traces or more iron in them like wood has none of that and then wood has no iron so it won t stick it will not stick because it is not magnetic
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_016_comb one is steel one is aluminum magnets stick to steel because they have traces of iron in them it does not stick to the aluminum because it has no traces of iron in it because it is probably steel or iron and only those two metals stick to magnets
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_021_comb so the only materials that did not stick were the river rock the brass ring and the aluminum nail because they have no traces of iron in them
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_018_comb iron iron makes magnet stick things with an iron in it because iron is like the magnets attraction it brings the magnet the magnet to it like magic it ll stay struck there because because the magnet really likes it it s made out of iron or steel which sticks to the magnet
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_014_comb okay so the wood block has no iron in it and it s not iron or steel so it will not stick magnets only stick to metal things with iron or anything it has iron in it we ve been learning about magnets
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_017_comb only certain metals stick to magnets aluminum does not stick to magnets steel does yes it must have iron or steel in it it will do nothing because it it s it has no iron in it but the black rock does the magnet is attracting the nail because it s either steel or iron
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_027_comb i think it s attractive because it has iron in it and iron sticks to magnets it s sticks because it has it s made out of steel which has iron in it it will because it s made out of steel it is made out of iron or steel magnets only stick to iron because they are made out of iron and iron is magnetic steel has traces of iron
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_003_comb we ve been told magnets stick to only things that are iron or steel we ve talked about how magnet stick to steel and iron only because they have iron in it magnets are made out of iron so iron makes things stick to the magnet because magnets only attracts iron or steel
myst_004031_2014-01-22_09-13-23_EE_3.1_028_comb it has to have iron in it so that so if there no iron in there it wouldn t have stuck but it has iron so it stick well magnets are made out of iron and they only stick to iron other magnets steel or super conductors
myst_004031_2014-01-28_08-25-01_EE_3.3_015_comb the magnet has to be a permanent magnet which is attracting the nail which makes it a temporary magnet which can pick up magnetic materials like the paperclip because they have poles and opposite poles attract the magnet the permanent magnet is transferring the magnetic force through the nail which makes it a magnet nothing because it s too thick
myst_004031_2014-01-28_08-25-01_EE_3.3_014_comb well the permanent magnet is making the nail temporary magnet by sending the magnetic force through the nail well it can go through like non magnetic materials as long as there as long as the magnet is strong enough or the object is not too thick
myst_004031_2014-01-28_08-25-01_EE_3.3_016_comb it has to be touching the nail magnets have opposite poles a north and a south pole when two opposite poles touch each other they attract but when two of the same poles touch each other they repel the permanent magnet is magnetizing everything else
myst_004031_2014-01-28_08-25-01_EE_3.3_017_comb when the magnet is touching the nail then it can transfer the magnetic force we have been learning about magnets attracting a piece of iron the magnetic field of those forces is like strong enough so that both magnets are attracting even through wood
myst_004031_2014-01-28_08-25-01_EE_3.3_021_comb well by taking the magnet of it demagnetized everything as a temporary magnet magnetism transfer between objects the magnetic force is making the magnets move the magnetic field is strong enough to pull both magnets together which makes them attract
myst_004031_2014-01-28_08-25-01_EE_3.3_025_comb the magnetism is transferring from the magnet to the nail to the paper clip well if it s thick if it s too thick then a magnet will not be able to attract something else and that s magnetic but if it s thin it will be able to because when there is no magnetic force it will not work
myst_004031_2014-01-28_08-25-01_EE_3.3_012_comb well the magnetic force is transferring through the nail the magnetic force is transferring through the materials to pick things up a magnet is attracting a steel nail which has magnetized the steel nail temporarily so because it s temporarily magnetized it can pick up a paperclip
myst_004031_2014-01-28_08-25-01_EE_3.3_019_comb well if the magnet is the permanent magnet it s not touching the temporary magnet it won t work because there was no magnetic force in the temporary magnet it magnetizes the core it s to be made from the steel or iron because those are the only magnetic materials
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_012_comb the wire is important because the wire makes that energy turn into magnetism the rivet is also important because it needs to be there so the wire coils can do their job
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_014_comb when you put this together with a closed circuit the energy is flowing from the batteries through the switch and through all those coils make back to the positive terminal which is creating a magnetic field it s flowing through the coil to magnetize it
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_005_comb well the energy goes through those coils really fast and that generates magnetic energy which can pick up any magnetic material washers are again caught into the magnetic field
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_006_comb so the energy flowing through those coils goes really fast so that creates a motion of spinning energy which magnetizes the rivet
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_017_comb well when you close the switch it magnetizes the core but if you when you are not testing it you want to turn of the circuit by opening the switch so the battery isn t wasted
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_013_comb well there got to be a switch because otherwise the battery always stores energy because electromagnets waste will use a lot of energy
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_010_comb well the energy is flowing from the negative terminal going through the switch through the coil and that energy is spiraling really fast which creates a magnetic field
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_019_comb well the magnetic fields like when the switch is closed the switch is closed the magnetic field acts and picks up washers but when you open the switch the magnetic field drops and the washers drop
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_018_comb well the switch protects the battery from drainage and it controls the flow of energy by releasing the magnetic field and turning it back on well when the current is not flowing there is no magnetic field because there is no spinning in the coil of the of the
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_021_comb well the switch is a component that protects the battery from drainage and it makes the magnet controllable either picking up stuff or off you wrap the coil with wire it magnetizes the core i just told you but the switch makes sure that the energy in the battery is not wasted
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_003_comb it s a metal an electromagnet is a steel or iron nail rivet or it s kind of like a screw it has wire wrapped around it the magnets are magnets that don t last forever electricity is flowing through that coil spinning around which creates a magnetic field
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_008_comb well right now there is no energy flowing so it s just a steel rivet you can t pick any thing up it s not a magnet it magnetizes the core we ve been learning out to make electromagnets which helps protect the battery from drainage because electromagnet uses a ton of energy
myst_004031_2014-02-11_08-41-38_EE_4.1_026_comb the energy has to be flow through that coil to magnetize the rivet well so it s a closed circuit and if the magnet is coiled with a lot of wire it have to be wrapped around iron or steel to magnetize the rivet
myst_004031_2013-11-19_09-52-45_EE_1.2_008_comb well if there was the wires have to be connected to the right contact points motor stops running because there is no energy for for it to run opens the electrical flow stops and energy can not flow back into the battery the flag is spinning and the flag is important so that so that it shows that the motion is happening
myst_004031_2013-11-19_09-52-45_EE_1.2_003_comb d cell is powering the motor in the circuit the circuit is open because the switch is not down since we have been learning about circuits and solar energy with with a motor energy has to flow through the circuit energy is flowing through the circuit now because all the contact points are touching the solar cell is taking the suns energy and making the motor run
myst_004031_2013-11-19_09-52-45_EE_1.2_020_comb well if the sun were not out everything would stop because then there would be no energy flow for for the circuit so so if the sun if it got cloudy there would be no energy to go into that solar cell solar cells take the suns energy and turn it into the the the electricity for a circuit to to work
myst_004031_2013-11-19_09-52-45_EE_1.2_007_comb the motor is moving energy is being transferred through the circuit the suns light is hitting the solar cell it opens and closes the switch when the switch is closed the motor will run when the switch is open the motor stops running starts to run because all the contact points are touching picture is showing the energy transfer from the battery to the motor and back to the battery
myst_004031_2013-11-19_09-52-45_EE_1.2_023_comb the motor starts to run because now there is energy the when you click on the sun it makes the circuit you have to close the switch since the motor is running we ve been learning about conductors and insulators well if you put an insulator on the insulators can act like an old like a brick wall allowing no electricity to flow through
myst_004031_2013-12-02_10-20-36_EE_1.3_004_comb well when you use a conductor the motor will run because energy is flowing but if you use an insulator the motor will not run those are all the parts that conduct electricity lighting like a pathway
myst_004031_2013-12-02_10-20-36_EE_1.3_007_comb well you could use like a steel nail smash or you could use like brass aka paper fastener or maybe even aluminum foil or copper it is open because this popsicle stick does not conduct electricity
myst_004031_2013-12-02_10-20-36_EE_1.3_008_comb the types of materials are like there are the pathway through the switch and insulators are just like a wall that stops electricity from flowing through the switch the insulators are all the parts that do not conduct electricity

myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_003_comb the nail is connecting the switch to the wire so that the motor is running and it is making a complete circuit yeah
myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_007_comb i observe that it is making a closed circuit and it s a conductor so and that means it s metal and so energy and electricity is running through
myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_012_comb i think it is i think it is closed but i am not exactly sure because there is something closing it just it is not working but i am not really sure it does not run because sponge a sponge is an insulator and it will not the electricity and energy will not flow through the wires
myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_014_comb conductors conduct the electricity so it goes from the d cell through the wire to the conductor and instead of the switch and it goes through the wire into the motor to make it run and then goes back into the negative side of the battery yep
myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_002_comb we have been using circuit boards and learning how to make a circuit and i forget the rest is your voice okay energy will not through flow through the wires to get to the motor so it will not work they are all metal and they are all conductors
myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_009_comb that it is not a complete circuit because popsicle stick isn t a conductor it is an insulator and that means it does not let electricity run all the way through it so it just not going to work all of the metal parts like the d cell battery the motor will really right in and here its all of the parts of the circuit
myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_004_comb the types are all metal and they need to that s the way that they work if it is not metal like if it is a straw popsicle stick then it won t work but like washers and nails and screws work
myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_005_comb the parts of the circuit is a nail and a switch but you could also just lay the nail over the switch to be the switch and you that the switch does not have to be there if its if the nail is going across also there is the motor three green wires and a d cell battery with a and a negative side
myst_004034_2013-12-02_09-52-54_EE_1.3_008_comb a conductor conducts electricity and so energy runs through it insulators do not let electricity run through them so it will not make the motor run i m doing very well how are you it makes the force weaker the force in between
myst_004034_2014-02-03_09-33-29_EE_3.4_006_comb they are no washers and the magnetic force is not been broken the magnet is using magnetism to hold the paperclip through the paper because it s makes the magnetic force weaker there are six spacers there and so it s harder for the magnet just stick together i ll click it
myst_004034_2014-02-03_09-33-29_EE_3.4_005_comb what we did we stuck a magnet there and we did washers how many washers broke the magnet the magnetic force has to go through as spacer so it might take less and like take less washers to go and to break the force
myst_004034_2014-02-03_09-33-29_EE_3.4_014_comb it s the magnetic force that just that keeps the magnets together and when you put things in between that makes it weaker and weaker like we did it with the stacks of paper it makes the magnetic force weaker because there s is more space in between and i just added just one washer and that was too much it broke the force it makes it makes it a lot weaker we re talking about magnets and what they stick to
myst_004034_2014-02-03_09-33-29_EE_3.4_004_comb there is not enough attraction it s too small to attract the magnet my graph shows that the less washers go in because it s weaker you put spacers there
myst_004034_2014-01-28_08-21-31_EE_3.3_009_comb the set of paper from the magnetic force is holding on to the paperclip and the thick one the magnetic force gets lost in all that paper its connected to the magnet it turned it into a temporary magnet the nail is picking up the paperclip
myst_004034_2014-01-28_08-21-31_EE_3.3_014_comb i think it s the magnet it s putting it s magnetism into the nail the magnets not touching the nail any more well it s we took a permanent magnet and had paperclip on the table and we picked it up
myst_004034_2014-01-28_08-21-31_EE_3.3_008_comb we had a bucket of materials and we tested to magnets together for on each of them the distance between them they re not close enough so they can t stick together the magnet is picking is sticking to the paper clips through the papers so the magnetic force works in through some material
myst_004034_2014-01-28_08-21-31_EE_3.3_004_comb magnetism is caused by the magnetic force and its the magnet is sending the some magnetism into the steel nail and it is holding on to the paperclip which is somewhat connected to that
myst_004034_2014-01-28_08-21-31_EE_3.3_021_comb when the magnet is touching the nail it can transfer the magnetic force into the steel nail if it s really thin then it can go through the paper if it s really thick then it can t they both used as magnets the real magnets is a permanent magnet the steel nail is a temporary magnet
myst_004034_2014-01-28_08-21-31_EE_3.3_006_comb the magnets are sticking together even through the table and they re moving each other we ve been seeing what happens when magnet a permanent magnet comes close or touches a piece of iron it s sending magnetism into the nail which is holding on the paperclip
myst_004034_2014-01-28_08-21-31_EE_3.3_020_comb it s so magnet if it s not touching that has to be touching the magnet to be a temporary magnet the magnetism is transferring between objects it s the magnetic force and it s very strong and they can stick together through to the table we have been learning about circuits and how to power a motor with a battery and a solar panel
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_011_comb it is a closed circuit and the motor is running you too marni see you next time sun has to be hitting the solar panel because that is what the the sun is the energy of this motor it works if the switch is down then the motor will run but if it is up it will not run the sun needs the sun
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_028_comb this picture is showing the energy from the battery flowing through the wires into the motor so the motor is running then the energy comes back out through the wire and goes back into the d cell battery i am good how are you
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_003_comb the electricity from the positive side of the d cell battery is going into the motor and making it run and then coming back out and into the negative side
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_026_comb if the sun is out then it will probably hit the solar panel and it will produce energy to make the motor run if it is a cloudy day then there is no energy for it to run so it can not run at all
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_019_comb the sun is hitting the solar panel or solar cell and the wires are taking that electricity into the motor so it is running and the other wire is bringing it back to the solar panel so it is reusable energy
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_018_comb they are also called solar panels and the sun hits it and that is what the energy is it does not need a battery it goes through the wires and to the motor to get it running that means that energy is flowing through the wires and into the motor from the d cell battery
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_021_comb the sun is hitting the solar panel and producing energy and the wire one wire is taking it into the motor and making it run and the other is taking it out back into the solar panel
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_017_comb the switch when the switch is open energy does not run completely through the circuit so energy stops where that wire where that switch is not connected so the motor can not run
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_010_comb well the motor is not running and i can see why because the little lever or switch is not making a complete circuit it is an open circuit not a closed circuit you need to have a closed circuit to to make a to make the motor run so if you had moved that switch over to the metal then it would work
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_023_comb it would not really work because the full because the sun would not be hitting it and it would not really work just cause that is the energy and the sun is d energy and d would not have the probably not but if there was a little bit of sun hitting the solar panel or solar cell which you call it then yes i think it would work
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_007_comb energy or electricity is running through the wires to get to the motor if the energy from the battery goes through the wires and into the motor the switch has to be touching the other little metal part so it is a closed so it is a closed circuit
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_006_comb both of the wires both of the one side of the wire has to be touching the and one side has to be and one other wire has to be touching the and and then they both have to be touching the points of the motor
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_025_comb if you click on the sun it gets sunny again and the motor starts to run and the flag is turning because it is not a closed circuit it was an open circuit when the switch was open and and not touching so electricity will not run in a full circle all the points have to be touching like all the terminals
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_013_comb it stops so energy or electricity can not get to the motor and make it run
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_016_comb it is touching the the the switch is touching the other metal parts that will run it is in the down position it will it is not up it is down
myst_004034_2013-11-19_09-47-45_EE_1.2_027_comb it stops turning cause there is no energy the flag it shows that the motor is moving but if you had dislocated one of the wires and the wire was not touching the d cell then the flag would not be moving i am good how are you the batteries are touching and there is only one lightbulb they are all connected in a parallel circuit
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_008_comb the light gets brighter the two bulbs and they each have two wires and they don t and they each get they have even amount of energy flowing through them so they re pretty bright its brighter the parallel circuit is brighter and the series circuit is more dim
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_020_comb they re both getting up from two batteries but this one only has two wires and the other one has four wires i m good at observing things
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_021_comb they re both are up they re both they re both a closed circuit that s what i was looking for yeah and they all have a light bulb
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_007_comb they each have their own pathway from they get they get but they get a wire each one at the and one at the negative there it s not lighting up if you it both on the same spot where it is and the base and the casing that it s there okay it is shorter and the lightbulbs are brighter series and parallel
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_024_comb no no there are two and two but they are getting the same amount of energy because that s a parallel circuit and that s another circuit and its working okay yeah
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_012_comb the direction of flow and it s all going and in the same direction but if you flip it around it was if you flip the d cell around it would start going in the other direction plus it is going through both of the light bulb from the battery it goes through the energy goes through the wires to the lightbulb and back to the battery
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_017_comb zero it s flowing into the and out the negative to the lightbulbs and back into because two lightbulbs have to share that one that one that one battery and that s not enough for them because it s three and its if they used the parallel circuits then that would be so much better
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_011_comb because of that that the energy is flowing through it and the bulbs are pretty dim because this is a series circuit not a parallel circuit its flowing all in the same direction
myst_004034_2013-12-17_09-19-34_EE_2.2_002_comb we have been learning i had about parallel circuits and series circuits also how to light two light bulbs and also how to light two bulbs lightbulbs at the same time its all flowing in the same direction zero my gosh do not get the concept
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_022_comb well it is flowing towards the and then out the negative so the direction it is going in a complete circle and it is going right from the negative side
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_015_comb it is going in a circle the energy is going into the light bulb lighting it up and then coming out of the light bulb using the other wire and back into the d cell battery and then it is going to start the whole circuit over again
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_030_comb i noticed that if you move the wires to the bulb casing then it will light up but then if you move it back to the bulb base both of them it will not light up but it does not matter which wire goes on which point of the battery it just matters that one wire is on the bulb base and one wire is on the bulb casing
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_026_comb it is coming out of the negative into the light bulb the electricity is going into the light bulb lighting the light bulb up going out of the light bulb and back into the positive side the wires they like they carry the energy through from i mean from the d cell into the light bulb
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_004_comb the battery has a and a positive side and you have to connect the wires to each side to make the light bulb actually work it receives the energy flowing through the wires into it it is the battery it is receiving the energy from the battery through the wires and into the lightbulb bulb
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_023_comb it just flipped around so now it is going it is it is
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_024_comb it turns the other way like if i click it again it is just flipping and the energy goes it but it is still going into the it is going into though the positive side and out the negative side into the light bulb so it kind of just flipped it is going the opposite direction
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_017_comb well it go it starts in the d cell battery and then you connect the wire and it goes out of the negative into the light bulb out of the light bulb and back into the positive it provides the energy that runs through the wires and into the light bulb
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_021_comb it they represent the electricity that is flowing through the wire into the light bulb and there are two little dots inside the light bulb that are spinning and that is going to come out the electricity that is not needed is going to come out and go back into the d cell battery
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_027_comb electricity is flowing out of the negative side into the light bulb and lighting the light bulb up coming out of the light bulb the electricity is coming out of the light bulb and back into the d cell that is what makes energy and so you connect the wires and then connect the wires to the light bulb
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_025_comb it is flowing away from the negative side but if you had flipped the battery it would be going out of the positive side it would not flow completely through cause it would not be there would not it would not be able to come out cause it would just be they would almost be both connected it would kind of be like connecting two wires together the energy and electricity
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_012_comb the wires one wire has to be touching the positive side of the battery and one wire has to be touching the negative side of the battery and then the other end of each of those wires has to be touching has to be touching the bulb base and the bulb casing
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_016_comb the direction it is going through the and and out the negative all of the components need to be connected cause if one wire was not touching the exact point or terminal terminal then it would electricity would not flow completely through and would not light the light bulb up
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_011_comb the light bulb is the thing that actually lights when you connect the wires to the battery and the wire the other side of the wires to the light bulb and on the bulb base and the bulb casing i have been learning about circuits and how to run a motor with a battery and a solar panel
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_019_comb well it is called the and it is going through and then it is going to go in to the d cell battery and then out the negative it flows towards the and goes out of the negative
myst_004034_2013-11-18_09-01-54_EE_1.1_014_comb i would say that it was a circuit cause it is running in a complete circle and once the energy comes up through the battery and it is going through the wires it goes to the light bulb and the light bulb lights up and then it goes back down into the d cell battery and does the whole thing over again the wires are the connection to the battery and the light bulb
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_006_comb it looks like it s moving with the flame because just because the flame is burning and so it s kind of moving a little bit the candle is melting i am not sure but yeah i am not sure
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_025_comb they both do not need to be plugged in they just absorb the light from the sun and run like the solar like the wind turbine it is it runs when light is there and the solar panels it will power whatever whatever its connecting
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_029_comb it would pollute the air i feel all the things that we have talked about logs which you can light on fire and that will make heat and light that gas or fuel that you put in your car apples which gives the which gives people energy and a candle which also gives off light and heat if you light
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_019_comb there will be smoke or steam these need the coal and fuel they do not they re not great for the environment and the other things will not do anything to the environment so they will give off pollution
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_011_comb there was not any sound it was just it did not sound like anything because wax does not makes i do not know could you help me it will pollute the air i answered that about three times now
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_026_comb they are both kind of bad for the earth and they are not that is not great and they i already say this they put pollution in to air i am not sure could you help me with that i am well how are you
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_005_comb it is the candle was lit and now it is melting i did not say anything about fuels but i guess fuels are what gets something running like fuels also known as know as gas for cars like a fuel like so there s energy for the car to run
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_004_comb energy is important because the apple that the girl is eating it looks delicious the energy from your hand is hitting the drum that is all i just finished talking
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_028_comb they are different because they pollute the air and a solar panel does not it is takes in sun light yeah the end good bye marnie i will see you next time bye it felt really warm and that is about it and the wax is really really hot
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_012_comb the flame is moving we have been learning about knowing when energy is present and like we did rotations where we made energy with different things like a candle and the stuff like that it gets foggy or smoky
myst_004034_2013-12-03_09-54-34_EE_1.4_013_comb the hands are beating the drums and the energy is coming from the hands because its hitting the drum they do not need to be plugged and or lit or anything like that they just absorb energy or i mean sun light and then they run
myst_004034_2014-01-22_09-01-19_EE_3.1_014_comb one is steel and one is aluminum the steel nail sticks but the aluminum one does not it won t stick because it doesn t have iron or steel in it they only stick to steel and iron please stop asking me that question all of the objects with steel or iron in them stick it s really weird that the black rocks sticks but it turns out that it has iron in it
myst_004034_2014-01-22_09-01-19_EE_3.1_002_comb yesterday we learned about magnets and what materials they stick to and we learned that they stick to steel and iron there all well the woodblock is not something that will stick to the magnet it has to be steel and iron i ve said that like fifty times now no jokes
myst_004034_2014-01-22_09-01-19_EE_3.1_005_comb then steel nail is attracted to the magnet it will stick because it is made of metal because of magnetic force the magnet will stick to the nail because it is made out of steel but the wood block is made out of wood so it doesn t stick it only sticks to steel and iron
myst_004034_2014-01-22_09-01-19_EE_3.1_010_comb because of magnetic force or just the objects and i m not today we talked about magnets and all of the objects that stick to it we learnt that the aluminum nail does not stick but a steel may does yeah black rock sticks because it has iron and steel in it that s why it will get stick
myst_004034_2014-01-22_09-01-19_EE_3.1_004_comb well i taught that they stick to all metals but it turns out that they are only attracted to each other like different magnets and steel and iron steel and iron it will attract about magnetism attracting and repelling
myst_007097_2014-04-04_11-04-07_EE_3.1_015_comb because it to have iron in it the block doesn t have iron and the magnet does the one with iron and that because has metal in it like the iron it s attracting to the fridge when you do north and south together they go protect when you do south and south together they will forward
myst_007097_2014-04-04_11-04-07_EE_3.1_026_comb the nail and the paper clip sticks to the metals that stick to magnets is and stuff that has iron in it because iron is like a magnet can you repeat that
myst_007097_2014-04-04_11-04-07_EE_3.1_036_comb that an iron sticks to magnets it will not attract it s because that has iron inside of its so this nail will attract because it has iron in it and and the river rock won t attract where the block won t attract because it doesn t have iron in it magnets stick to iron
myst_007097_2014-04-04_11-04-07_EE_3.1_018_comb it has iron both of them have iron in it so that s why it was because one has iron and one doesn t have it will not stick it will attract they have north and south on side and the other south and north great how are you
myst_007097_2014-04-04_11-04-07_EE_3.1_008_comb the nail is attracting to is because one doesn t have iron and one does have iron when you try to connected to the block they won t attracts because as iron inside of it it doesn t have iron inside of it s it s middle and inside the fridge is metal to and metal and metal or iron and iron will go together and attract
myst_007097_2014-04-04_11-04-07_EE_3.1_019_comb like a nail will stick to a fridge paper clip and all stuff that has iron in it the 21s one is on a bottom or attracting and then the other three are repelling brings out that noise go together it will
myst_007097_2014-04-02_12-52-18_EE_3.2_007_comb when south and north go together it will attract whenever north and north it will repel south and south will repel south and north will attract because it gives you the girl is give energy and her body
myst_007097_2014-03-18_08-14-01_EE_1.4_005_comb candle and it released science because because it is giving energy i don t know energy will not work i don t know do you wish to the series circuit will replace that because its traveling energy from the and then when you get into the minus will go through the and back to the switch and then to the light bulb and then back to the minus
myst_007097_2014-04-02_12-56-13_EE_2.3_013_comb it will light up the energy will stop on this it will burn out because it s broken because one of the light bulb run out of energy because the energy starts it runs out when it works it will when it broke it will
myst_007097_2014-04-02_12-56-13_EE_2.3_019_comb it breaks because it been on to one probably it s the first energy to the second energy to the third energy and when it breaks it will when also than when they put into light bulb in it will go back the energy will start energy is bring in it to connect
myst_007097_2014-04-02_12-56-13_EE_2.3_007_comb its its once side the plus are going to around into the switch and then back into the light bulb and then into the minus will run out the energy will start it will light up the bulb it will give a lot of energy they make the wire
myst_007097_2014-02-06_08-02-09_EE_1.1_028_comb its moving to the minus way to help you see it is lighting up the light it goes the other direction
myst_007097_2014-02-06_08-02-09_EE_1.1_009_comb it is yourself provides a because so the wires if you put the wires on the the battery in the input on to the light later because they has source it goes up the wire and then into the left to make a light on the side and make goes down the light bulb back into the it doe not light up
myst_007097_2014-02-06_08-02-09_EE_1.1_015_comb carry the electricity i think it helps the light light up to let the light bulb light the battery and the light it is flowing to the light bulb and then and to the its because the d cell has the energy
myst_007097_2014-03-18_09-58-02_EE_2.1_016_comb its giving energy through the d cell actually like one of them go ahead next to the light bulb and then the activity cell the energy will go pass will pass through the circuit is giving a path way because the d cell has the energies to go through the two light bulbs
myst_007097_2014-03-18_09-58-02_EE_2.1_009_comb the d cell had been electricity in their so because through the wire into the light bulb then through the next wire it may contain d cell might not have energy the d cell is giving energy to light bulb trying to make light bulb later because the two d cells are connected together it will light up lighter it gives the energy it will spin its going around the wires and into the motor to make
myst_007097_2014-02-11_13-08-13_EE_1.2_029_comb it will stop it will stop spinning it will turn on to give power source the solar system the flag is spinning the wires have to touch it the wires are connecting to the the motor and its making the motor goes through the its making motor spin and then other one is going through
myst_007097_2014-02-24_12-56-05_EE_1.3_018_comb the sponge is an insulator because it is not melt when you put the sponge on it it will not spin the wire is going through the the wire is going through into the motor to make it spin it is made from electricity it will not spin i think it is fish wire it is fish like the like k the kind of string you use to catch fish
myst_996428_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_019_comb get one end of the propeller and spin it around so it can have more air it gives it more air so you can so you can so you can fly faster like the other one except the top one is a little bit down and the other one is kind of like hanging around like not that high there are two airplanes and they are on string
myst_996428_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_005_comb the straws popsicle sticks that thing that goes can get some air and yeah that is it if you put the string like the other one they are both the same cause it is the same height they are the they are like going straight and that one the one is not going down
myst_996428_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_004_comb the planes are p are on this on li like fish string you use to catch fish and they are and they are like flying like real airplanes i mean planes one is going straight and the other one is kind of going down if you did not have the string it could not fly cause it needs string to fly it
myst_996428_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_013_comb the propeller propeller is to the to the to the rubber band and the rubber bands is what a make makes it fly so if you did not have a propeller it would not fly without the propeller it would not fly because any you need to spin it and the rubber band would have nowhere to to make the rubber band tighter
myst_996428_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_009_comb you would put them on on the string you would tie it to a chair then put the airplane and see how many winds it would take to put make if fly put them on the string then t that we have to see how many once we have we have to to to a get it to fly
myst_996428_2009-28-09_00-00-00_VB_3.2_027_comb the one is that kind of the one that is kind of going down cause it is more straight up so it would not be that much hard but the one that is on the bottom it would be that a bit more hard because it is weight it is downer and you need a lot of air to make it fly i did not really hear you that time it is going to be harder for the the for the one that is going down cause it is going to need way more air than the other one you need i think you need the
myst_996428_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_015_comb i think you can put it it depends on what kind of things they are like if it is something really heavy i do not think it will it will jump that high but if if it is something really light i think it is going to jump really far
myst_996428_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_005_comb you need something like to like you need a stick then you put it through this little hole and put something it i do not know what it is called but then you push down and it like jumps up it jumps up like to see how high you should put the catapult it depends on how high because if you do it low and it will not jump as near far as the high higher one
myst_996428_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_017_comb if you do not do it that h that low i do not think it is going to jump really far you can put the the cork you and the rubber the rubber stopper
myst_996428_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_011_comb you put the flipper base on on like the little things then it then if you put it high i think the the the flip stick will will go like the flip stick will get a bit higher then the then the cork will jump on the little i think more higher than if you put it low
myst_996428_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_010_comb these things these things are like the flipper the flipper base the cork the rubber s the rubber stopper the flip stick and the angle brace you really you i think that is the most important part of it because without em the cork will have no where to s to sit on and it would not jump at all
myst_996428_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_019_comb need it because yeah i think cause it has some black lines on em and two little stick things on em and between i think between those sticks you put a cork and that is i think that is how it jumps the stick is really important because without the stick it would not have anything to to stand on and it would not have anything like to stand on and jump off
myst_996428_2009-05-10_00-00-00_VB_4.1_007_comb i do not know that yet because we just started we just started with them so but i do not really know all about that i think you need the the propeller system because if without em it would not the cork would not fly s it will it will kind of make it it would kind of be like a champion like without that the thing on the bottom you could you can jump people and people
myst_996428_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_008_comb we had to see how much pennies it could ca they remind me of like the pennies being passengers i they remind me about how many pennies we have to put until it sinks you it has less weight cause you have to make them float or they will doctor or they will or they will drown we have been learning about boats we have been learning how to make boats
myst_996428_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_010_comb we cou we have to see how many pennies it can fit until it drowned it i did not get that question very well cause it has more weight and when you throw it from high it
myst_996428_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_005_comb first we have to cut three inches then fill it up all the way up and s and put it in these mesher thingies then we had to see how how much water it could get get in the like put in the the boat the taller one can can carry more cause it is taller and the smaller one can carry c carries less cause it is smaller to float on water and so people could get on them and see the ocean
myst_996428_2009-17-09_00-00-00_VB_2.1_012_comb a lot of pennies there is some pennies in this paper cup and floating in water

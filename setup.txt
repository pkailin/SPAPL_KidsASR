1. in venv: 
python -m pip install --upgrade pip (upgrade python)
pip install torch transformers==4.32.1 datasets
pip install soundfile librosa numpy

2. to install kaldi: 
# Clone Kaldi repository
git clone https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi.git

# Build the tools (including sclite)
cd kaldi/tools
extras/check_dependencies.sh  # Install any missing dependencies it reports

Data: 
wav.scp file: connects every utterance (sentence said by one person during particular recording session) with an audio file related to this utterance.

/src/data/whisper_loader.py: loads dataset for Whisper, does data augmentation based on arguments in whisper_small_train.yaml

FOR OGI DATASET: 
Stage 1: Evaluation of Whisper (in run_whisper.sh) 
/egs/OGI/data/dev/wav.scp 
/egs/OGI/data/dev/text

/egs/OGI/data/test/wav.scp 
/egs/OGI/data/test/text

/egs/OGI/data/spont_al/wav.scp 
/egs/OGI/data/spont_al/text

tasks, both OGI and MyST: 
1. stage 1: evaluation of baseline whisper model 
2. run stage 2 and 3: full-finetuning without data augmentation 
3. run stage 2 and 3: full-finetuning with VTLP 
4. run stage 2 and 3: full-finetuning with SP 
5. run stage 2 and 3: full-finetuning with PP 
6. run stage 2 and 3: full-finetuning with SA

try combinations: 
1. SA + PP
2. SA + SP 
3. SA + VTLP

try PIF with VLTP and PP.
